	<p>A lot of work has gone into making Cone's grammar simple and clear.
	The lesser benefit is that code creation is faster and easier to remember.
	The greater benefit is that the resulting concise, readable code is easier to understand and improve,
	especially when one's eyes are not distracted by unnecessary, space-consuming boilerplate.</p>
	<p>On another page, we will review Cone's rich code reuse mechanisms which can also play a huge
	role in keeping code small, by making it easier to create a single piece of code that
	well serves a number of diverse needs. For now, let's concentrate on Cone's grammatical shortcuts
	that help keep Cone programs small and easy-to-understand:</p>
	
	<p><b>Significant indentation</b></p>
	<p>By default, Cone supports <a href="coneref/reftoken.html#line">significant indentation</a>.
	Rather than requiring curly braces { } to mark the begin and end of blocks,
	as other systems programming languages do, Cone infers blocks according to variations in line indentation.
	A new block starts when line indentation increases. When indentation is restored, the block ends.
	Similarly, statement ending semi-colons are implicitly assumed to exist at the end of lines:</p>
<pre>
fn fact(nbr u32)
  if nbr&lt;=1
    1
  else
    n*fact(n-1)
</pre>
	<p>This approach eliminates both the visual distraction and the need to type these punctuation characters.
	Another benefit is that code takes up less space vertically, allowing more of the meat of the program
	to be visible in a code editor. 
	The resulting code often looks like a neat, clean, declarative outline.</p>
	<p>Significant indentation is controversial.
	Personal preferences and IDE tools vary. Some programmers prefer to write code that uses
	curly braces and semi-colons. Cone easily supports this style as well.
	When it notices the presence of curly braces, it automatically switches to free form mode
	and thereafter expects explicit semicolons and closing braces.</p>
	
	<p><b>With blocks</b></p>
	<p>'with' blocks are one of Cone's more distinctive features.
	They make it possible to create declarative-looking code blocks that
	concisely build or manipulate complex data collections (such as 3D content).</p>
	<p>A 'with' block starts with an expression which establishes the value/collection to focus on.
	Throughout the course of the block, the pseudo-variable <span class="pre">this</span>
	refers to that value. More importantly, the dot ('.') and '&lt;-' operators
	can implicitly refer to <span class="pre">this</span>:</p>
<pre>
// A <span class="pre">with</span> block, where 'this' refers to the Frosty npc
with $.npcs["Frosty"]
    .inventory // work with Frosty's inventory ..
        &lt;- magnifying_glass  // add to the inventory
        &lt;- cowboy_hat
	.size *= .reducer   // equivalent to: this.size = this.size * this.reducer
	with .dictionary // work with Frosty's dictionary
		.["carrot"]: "wortel"  // add a word and its translation
    .["coal"]: "steenkool"
  .jump(2.0)          // equivalent to: this.jump(2.0) 
</pre>
	<p>Although 'with' blocks can sometimes resemble and act like method cascades,
	  Cone's 'with' block mechanism is considerably more versatile and flexible.
	In human conversations, we regularly use pronouns like "it" or "we" as placeholders 
	to refer to something specific within the context of each conversation. 
	Such pronouns make conversations pithier and less stilted.
	'this' plays a similar role in Cone programs.</p>
	<p>When used in conjunction with significant indentation,
	'with' blocks make it possible for Cone, as a procedural language,
	to express and work with content as concisely and declaratively as any markup language.
	Furthermore, the indented, compositional structure of Cone's code greatly facilitates 
	the modular "snap-together" assembly of strings, collections, and 3D world parts.</p>
	
	<p><b>Type Inference</b></p>
	<p>A key reason most statically-typed languages are somewhat more verbose than dynamic languages
	is the requirement for type annotations scattered throughout the code.
	Type inference and defaults go a long way towards reducing this overhead.</p>
	<p>Cone supports unidirectional type inference, which means that type annotations
	are generally required on function signatures and object creation, but can mostly
	be avoided otherwise (particularly variable declarations).
	Furthermore, Cone supports type defaults for the most common usage.
	For example, '&amp;' defaults to a const, borrowed reference.
	Similarly, methods allow a parameter's type to be omitted, should it be the same as the type
	that the method is declared within.</p>
	
	<p><b>High-level Control Abstractions</b></p>
	<p>Although <span class="pre">if</span> and <span class="pre">while</span> control structures
	offer general-purpose flexibility, there are certain control flow patterns that
	are common enough that more-concise formulations are worth baking into Cone:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><span class="pre">each</span> loops collapses the detailed mechanics of iterating over a sequence
	of values into a single line. 
	Invisible to the coder, it automates iterator creation, value binding, incrementation and destruction
	in a safe, type-generic way.</li>
	<li><span class="pre">match</span> collapses the detailed mechanics of matching a single value
	to a sequence of patterns in a type-generic way. Key to its simplicity is the ability to safely
	bind extracted contents from any successful matches.</li>
	<li>RAII and move semantics collapses the detailed mechanics of ensuring that allocated
	resources are safely disposed of at the end of their lexical lifetime, avoiding the need
	for explicit invocation of finalizers and free logic.</li>
	<li><span class="pre">panic</span> collapses the detailed mechanics of safely handling exception
	conditions, providing a fast path to the exit door that ensures open resources have been successfully
	disposed of.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Return inference</b></p>
	<p>As the earlier indentation example showed, the <span class="pre">return</span> keyword can often be omitted.
	Functions that don't return a value don't need it. Functions that do return one or more values,
	can specify the values to return on the last line.
	This inference bubbles into <span class="pre">if</span> and <span class="pre">match</span> control structures,
	as illustrated above.</p>
	<p>Implicit return is consistent with Cone treating blocks and if/match structures as expressions.
	Just like return inference, the last value in each block is treated as the computed value for that block.
	Such consistency simplifies code refactoring and makes macro expansions more versatile.</p>
	
	<p><b>Control clauses</b></p>
	<p>Control clauses (inspired by Ruby) make it possible to append to a statement expression
	one or more <span class="pre">if</span>, <span class="pre">while</span> or <span class="pre">each</span> control clauses.
	The earlier factorial example can be made even simpler this way:</p>
<pre>
fn fact(nbr u32)
  return 1 if nbr&lt;=1
  n*fact(n-1)
</pre>
	<p>Prudence is advised here, as sometimes use of control clauses can make code a bit harder to read,
	especially if the code editor does not color highlight the control clause's keyword.
	However, control clauses are often ideal for short statements, like return, break, continue or
	brief expressions.</p>
	
	<p><b>Tuples</b></p>
	<p>Tuples (ad hoc structs) greatly improve the convenience of working with multiple values simultaneously.
	Implicit use of tuples avoids the code overhead involved with declaring the data structure
	and then individually moving around (destructuring) each element of the tuple.
	Important use cases for tuples are parallel assignment, multiple return values and
	marshalling queued-messaging data for use by a thread or actor.</p>
<pre>
a,b = b,a                      // parallel assignment used to swap values
success, result = action(val)  // multiple return values
</pre>

	<p><b>Operator Overloading</b></p>
	<p>Infix punctuation operators are both concise and readily digestible, far more so than
	named functions and methods. 
	Cone allows any type to define appropriate methods for a large number of these operators,
	include equality comparisons, pattern matching, arithmetic and logic operators,
	and even various operator assignments (e.g., '+=').</p>
