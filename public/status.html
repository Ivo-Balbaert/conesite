	<div class="text">
	<p>Development of the Cone language and compiler is ongoing.
	Neither are even half-way towards a minimally-viable product.</p>
	<p>Please realize that the features described on this largely-personal web site
	are sometimes aspirational in nature: depicting the language as it is envisioned to be.
	The text accurately describes working features, 
	but it also sketches out features that have not yet been implemented.</p>
	<p>The evolving compiler is always left in a working state.
	Using the LLVM library, it is able to generate minimal, optimized executables
	for Windows, Linux, OSX and WebAssembly.</p>
	
	<h2>Current Capability</h2>
	<p>The Cone compiler currently supports these basic capabilities:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Callable functions that use variables, numeric expressions, and simple
	control structures such as 'if' and 'while', as demonstrated by this code which
    <a href="http://cone.jondgoodwin.com/play/index.html?gist=4510655502edcde9d50d185cfd7f3c2e">
	calculates the value for pi</a>.
	This includes support for 
	<a href="http://cone.jondgoodwin.com/play/index.html?gist=37ce069ddb6cbe298b738769280b6c02">
	multiple return values and parallel assignment.</a></li>
	<li><a href="coneref/refstruct.html">struct types</a>, composed of fields and methods,
	including operator overloading
	(see <a href="http://cone.jondgoodwin.com/play/index.html?gist=cd702c7c1ffc8f97d7762735d04fd9de">
	this example</a>).</li>
	<li>Fixed-size <a href="coneref/refarray.html">arrays and slices</a> (see 
	<a href="http://cone.jondgoodwin.com/play/index.html?gist=be8e6caddf81aa8f416a244093f87a51">
	this example</a>).
	<li><a href="coneref/refrefs.html">Reference and pointer types</a>, which includes
	basic support for single-owner, ref-counted and borrowed references.
	This includes support for nullable and function references,
	static permissions, move semantics, and raw pointers
	(including pointer arithmetic).</li>
	<li>Module & Type namespaces.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Near-term Improvements</h2>
	<p>Development work is currently focused on these areas:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Extending arrays:dynamically-allocated, struct-based collections, and builder blocks.</li>
	<li>Interfaces, closures, iterators, and 'each' blocks.</li>
	<li>Variant types and pattern matching.</li>
	<li>Constructors, finalizers and "set" methods</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Future Features</h2>
	<p>Over a longer term, development will focus on:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Concurrency: threads, channels, runtime permissions</li>
	<li>Generics, traits and metaprogramming</li>
	<li>Adding strict safety checks to a program's use of references.</li>
	<li>Error handling</li>
	<li>Tracing GC, Arenas, Pools</li>
	</ul>
