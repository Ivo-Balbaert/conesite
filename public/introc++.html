		<p>C++ is the workhorse programming language for 3D game development.
			Despite being over 30 years old, C++ gets regular updates that modernize and improve its features. 
			C++ works, but its use still carries a significant productivity cost:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Include files.</b>
				Every class requires two redundant files, wasting programmer time.</li>
			<li><b>Build system</b>. C++ package and dependency management are difficult and error-prone processes.</li>
			<li><b>Memory and concurrency safety</b>. C++ does not enforce reference safety, which means
				people waste time with extra testing, hard-to-diagnose bugs, and handling security vulnerabilities.</li>
			<li><b>Complexity</b>. The specification for C++ runs to hundreds of pages.
			    This is a language that takes a long time to learn to use well.</li>
			<li><b>Missing features.</b> Many of the valuable features listed above are not supported by C++,
				particularly: variant types, built-in concurrency, slices, and tuples, 
				as well as all Cone-exclusive features.</li>
		</ul>
