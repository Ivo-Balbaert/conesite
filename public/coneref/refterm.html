    <div class="text">

		<p>This chapter talks about the term: a literal, a variable, 
		or a <a href="#pseudo">pseudo-variable</a> (e.g., 'this' or 'self').
		Each term references a single value of a specific type.
		The term is the basic building block for an expression.</p>
		<p>You might be tempted to skip over this chapter,
		because it seems to cover concepts familiar to you from other languages.
		That is somewhat, but not entirely, true.</p>
		<p>Importantly, this chapter introduces the distinction that Cone makes between
		different kinds of types: value, permission, allocator and lifetime.
		This fundamental distinction impacts many aspects of the language,
		including how variables are declared and how assignment works.</p>

		<h2>Value type</h2>
		<p>A <b>value type</b> specifies how a value is encoded inside the computer.
		For example, an integer is encoded differently than a collection of characters.
		Value type also establishes what sort of things you can do with a value
		(e.g., add two numbers together).</p>
		<p>Cone provides a number of built-in value types.
		Later on, we will describe how to define new compound value types using 
		type constructors like struct, array, pointer, class, interface, etc.<p>
		<p>The names of value types are capitalized by convention.
		This helps cleanly separate the global namespace between value types and variables,
		reducing unexpected naming conflicts and improving code clarity.
		One notable exception to this naming convention is the type names for the primitive numeric types:
		<ul>
		<li><span class="pre">i8</span>, <span class="pre">i16</span>,
		<span class="pre">i32</span> and <span class="pre">i64</span>
		are the names of types for signed integers of the specified bit-size.</li>
		<li><span class="pre">u8</span>, <span class="pre">u16</span>,
		<span class="pre">u32</span> and <span class="pre">u64</span>
		are the type names for unsigned integers.</li>
		<li><span class="pre">f32</span> and <span class="pre">f64</span>
		are the type names for floating point numbers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Although there are other kinds of types (e.g., allocator or permission type),
		when we talk about the type of a value, we are typically referring to its value type.</p>
		
		<h2>Literal</h2>
		<p>A literal is a specific unchangeable value,
		as represented by a <a href="reftoken.html#number">number</a> token, 
		<a href="reftoken.html#string">string</a> token,
		<a href="reftoken.html#char">character</a> token,
		or the reserved names <span class="pre">null</span>, 
		<span class="pre">true</span> or <span class="pre">false</span>.
		For example (with comments to indicate each literal's type):</p>
<pre>
123     // i32: signed 32-bit integer
3.4     // f32: 32-bit floating point number
"Hello" // String
'a'     // u32: utf-8 character code
false   // Bool
null    // Null (represents the absence of a value)
</pre>
		<p>Numeric literals default to the appropriate signed, 32-bit value type.
		If a different value type is desired for a number, simply append the desired
		type to the number (e.g., <span class="pre">65u8</span> is an unsigned 8-bit byte literal).</p>
		<p>The presence of a decimal point, exponent or floating point type suffix 
		signals that a number is a floating point literal.
		<span class="pre">d</span> may be used instead of <span class="pre">f64</span> 
		to specify a 64-bit floating point number.</p>
		<p><b>Note</b>
		All literals are flagged as immutable. Any attempt to modify them will generate an error message.
		This ensures literals can never be corrupted by any downstream code.</p>
		
		<h2 id="vars">Variable</h2>
		<p>A variable holds a single value of a specific value type. 
		A variable's value is set and retrieved using its "unique" name.</p>
		
		<h3>Variable declarations</h3>
		<p>Variables must be declared prior to use.
		The purpose of a variable declaration is to specify its value type, permission, and scope (lexical lifetime)
		in advance of its use later in the program.
		Doing so provides invaluable context to the variable's use, 
		allowing the compiler to optimize execution performance and memory use,
		as well as enforce safety constraints.</p>
		<p>A variable declaration statement typically begins with either
		<span class="pre">imm</span> or <span class="pre">mut</span> followed by the variable name
		(an <a href="reftoken.html#ident">identifier token</a>) and then the value type.
		For example:
<pre>
imm height f32  // height holds a floating point number
</pre>

		<h3>Permissions</h3>
		<p>The difference between <span class="pre">imm</span> and <span class="pre">mut</span>
		rests with the permission you are granting the variable.
		A variable's permission enables and constrains how it may be used, 
		properties which can help improve a program's safety and comprehensibility.
		The compiler enforces a permission's constraints on every use of the variable.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><span class="pre">imm</span> (immutable)
		declares that the variable's value will never change after it is initialized.</li>
		<li><span class="pre">mut</span> (mutable) allows a variable value to be changed after initialization.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Cone supports a number of other permissions in addition to
		<span class="pre">imm</span> and <span class="pre">mut</span>.
		The <a href="refperm.html">Permissions</a> chapter offers a more thorough
		treatment of all permissions, the capabilities they enable and deny,
		and the implications for using each.
		There is no one perfect permission that can do everything.
		Each has its advantages and limitations.
		That said, <span class="pre">imm</span> and <span class="pre">mut</span> are a good starter set.</p>
		
		<h3 id="scope">Scope, Lifetime and Allocator</h3>
		<p>The location of the variable declaration statement implicitly determines the variable's scope.
		This scope establishes several things about the variable: which part of memory it resides within,
		how long the it lives (its lexical lifetime) and which parts of a program's code can access it.</p>
		<p>There are two key places where a variable can be located:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>global</b> variables are declared outside of all function blocks.
		Space for them is allocated automatically when a program is loaded for execution.
		Global variables are shared across and accessible by any function at any time.</li>
		<li><b>local</b> variables are declared within a function block.
		Every time a function is called, space is allocated on the current stack
		for all its declared local variables.</p>
		<p>Local variables are exclusive to that call.
		Two identically-named local variables in different functions,
		or even two calls to the same function, will not collide with each other.
		Local variables provide a working state for the function.
		When the function is finished and returns to its caller, 
		its local variable space is automatically freed from the stack.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Thus:</p>
<pre>
imm glowy i32     // Global immutable variable
fn a_function()
  mut loco f32    // Local mutable variable
</pre>
		<p>The lifetime of global variables is the same as the program's lifetime.
		Global variables come into being when the program starts and disappear when the program stops.</p>
		<p>By contrast, the lifetime of a local variable is bounded by the inner-most lexical block
		the variable is declared within.
		(Additional indentation of lines typically signals entrance into a new inner block.)
		The variable is unknown outside its declared scope;
		any attempt to access it outside its lexical block will fail.</p>
<pre>
fn a_function()
  mut loco f32
  while true
    mut x i32  // indentation shows x's lifetime is bounded by while block
  x // Error!! x is not accessible here outside the while block
</pre>
		<p>As a side note: Cone considers <span class="pre">global</span> and <span class="pre">local</span>
		to be <b>allocators</b>. Cone has other allocators which focus on heap and reference pointers.
		The <a href="refalloc.html">Pointers and Allocators</a> chapter offers an extensive treatment
		of allocators and reference pointers.
		It explains how variable lifetimes can constrain the aliasing and use of variables and reference pointers.</p>
		
		<h2 id="#pseudo">Pseudo-variables</h2>
		<p>Pseudo-variables look like variables, but are not, as their value is managed by Acorn based on the
		context where they are encountered. They need not be declared, as the compiler already
		knows their value type, scope, allocator, and permission (usually <span class="pre">imm</span>).
		<p>Two commonly used pseudo-variables are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="refmethod.html#self"><span class="pre">self</span></a>,
		the value which is passed to a method, indicating what the method is supposed to be acting on.</li>
		<li><a href="refcollect.html#this"><span class="pre">this</span></a>,
		the value that is the focus of attention within a 'this' block.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="assign">Assignment</h2>
		<p>The value of a variable is set using an assignment.
		Variables placed to the left of the assignment operator <span class="pre">=</span> set the variable's value. 
		Variables found to the right (or most anywhere else) retrieve the value of the variable.</p>
<pre>
height = 3.4     // height's value is now 3.4
depth = height   // weight's value is now 3.4
number = 42      // number's value has discovered the meaning of life
</pre>

		<h3>Assignment type checking</h3>
		<p>In order for an assignment to be valid, the variable on the left has to be mutable
		and the value types have to match on both sides of the <span class="pre">=</span>.
		The most obvious way for them to match is if they are the same.
		However, in some cases it is possible for them to be different and still match,
		as happens with <a href="refexpr.html#numconv">automatic number conversion</a>
		and <a href="refsubtype.html">subtyping</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Copy, move and reference pointers</h3>
		<p>For most value types, the assignment operator stores a <i>copy</i> of the value on the right
		into the variable on the left.</p>
		<p>However, if the value type is a reference pointer (or contains one),
		aliasing rules kick into effect.
		Depending on the pointer's information regarding permissions, allocators, lifetime and value types,
		the assignment might be invalid (with a compiler error), trigger a change of ownership,
		or be wrapped in aliasing/dealiasing logic specific to the allocator.
		These rules are detailed in the <a href="refalloc.html">Pointers and Allocators</a> chapter.</p>
		
		<h3>Variable declaration initialization</h3>
		<p>Variable declarations permit assignments as part of the declaration.
		These assignments establish the initial value of the declared variable:</p>
<pre>
mut height f32 = 5.2
</pre>
		<p>Variable declarations offer one more trick up their sleeve: <i>type inference</i>.
		If typing information is omitted on the left-hand variable,
		the variable's value type is declared to be the value type of the expression to the right.</p>
<pre>
mut height = 5.2
</pre>
		
		<h3 id="parallel">Parallel Assignment</h3>
		<p>Parallel assignment makes it possible to simultaneously assign multiple values to multiple variables.
		This can be convenient when swapping the values held by two variables:</p>
<pre>
// Swap the variable values for a and b
a,b = b,a
</pre>
