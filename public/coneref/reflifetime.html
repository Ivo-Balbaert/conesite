	<h3>'static lifetime</h3>
	<p>The lifetime of a global variable is forever.
		The same is true for all functions, methods and anonymous functions.
		Any reference created directly from a global variable or function is implicitly marked 
		with the <span class="pre">'static</span> lifetime annotation.
		A reference may always safely point to a value that is known to be global,
		as this never violates lifetime constraints.</p>
	<p>References to functions preserve this <span class="pre">'static</span> lifetime even when a function reference
		is passed from one function to another.
		This means that function references can always be moved around freely and safely
		between functions and safely stored and used anywhere,
		without the need to explicit annotate them with <span class="pre">'static</span>.</p>
	<p>However, that is not true for global variables when references to them are passed
		around and stored. Unless the receiver reference (and any donor reference) are explicitly marked with
		<span class="pre">'static</span>, lifetime shortening and constraints will apply.
