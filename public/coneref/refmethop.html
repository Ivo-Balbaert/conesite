    <div class="text">

	<p>A number of method names have an important built-in role in various Cone features.</p>

	<h2 id="compare">Comparison methods</h2>
	<p>TBD: </p>

	<h2>Operator methods</h2>
	<p>Many operators are implemented as method calls. For instance, <span class="pre">x+3</span>
	is treated as if it were:  <span class="pre">x.`+`(3)</span>
	A type need only implement the <span class="pre">`+`</span> method to
	make the <span class="pre">+</span> operator meaningful to values of that type.
	If a program tries to apply the <span class="pre">+</span> operator to a value 
	whose type has not implemented the <span class="pre">`+`</span> method,
	a compiler error results.</p>
	<p>This principle applies to all the arithmetic, arithmetic assignment, and comparison operators.
		It also applies to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>`[]`</b> for indexing or slice creation</li>
		<li><b>`()`</b> for function calls (this allows a struct to become a closure)</li>
		<li><b>`&lt;&lt;` and `&gt;&gt;`</b> for append and prepend</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Structs as indexed collections</h2>
	<p>More complex collections may be created using the built-in array types as a foundation.
			This is typically accomplish by defining a struct with a dynamic array as one of the fields.
			This custom collection can handle all of the operations described earlier
			because these capabilities are invoked as methods on the struct object.
			The struct's methods can then forward these requests down to the dynamic array as appropriate.</p>
	<p>These are the implicit names for these methods:</p>
	<ul>
			<li><b>[]</b> - single-element indexing (get and set) if there is one argument,
					and multi-element indexing if there are two.</li>
			<li><b>&[]</b> - get borrowed reference to a single element</li>
	</ul>
	
<h3>Implicit methods</h3>
	<p>Various language constructs call certain methods under the covers:</p>
	<ul>
			<li><b>.init</b> is the default <a href="refallocref.html#initializer">initializer</a>
				for newly allocated values</li>
			<li><b>.drop</b> is the <a href="refallocref.html#finalizer">finalizer</a>
				called when before an allocated value is freed</li>
			<li><b>.clone</b> is called when making a copy of a "non-copyable" value</li>
			<li><b>.each</b> is called by the <span class="pre">each</span> block to create an iterator</li>
		<li><b>.`~~`</b> is the default match operator for <span class="pre">match</span> blocks</li>
		<li><b>.`&lt;&lt;`</b> is the default append operator used for <span class="pre">build</span> blocks</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>set methods (Computed Properties)</h2>
	<p>By default, methods typically operate in "get" mode,
		invoked as part of an expression and often returning one or more values.
		However, it is possible for a method to be used on the left-hand side of an assignment.
		These are called "set" methods,
		and are declared by specifying <span class="pre">set</span> before <span class="pre">fn</span>.
	</p>
<pre>
struct Counter
	count u32
	fn counter() u32 {count += 1}          // a "getter" method
	set fn counter(cnt u32) {count = cnt}  // a "setter" method
</pre>
  <p>The following example shows the use of this pair of get and set methods:
<pre>
mut x = Counter{0}
x.counter // 1
x.counter // 2
x.counter = 10 // uses the "setter" to set the value
x.counter // 11
</pre>
	<p>A "set" method can only be invoked to the left of an assignment operator.
		The value to be assigned is passed to the setter method as its last argument.
	</p>
	<p>It is worth noting that with both the setter and getter method use,
		it is permissable to omit the parentheses when no additional arguments are passed.
		This makes the use of get and set methods look exactly like property access.
		This visual symmetry means that a type can migrate from making its fields public,
		to making them private, but still offering a compatible public interface of the same name
		using methods.
	</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> From the outside, a field and a computed property (a get/set method)
		look identical. The user of a struct does not care if it is working with a stored value
		or a value mediated by methods.</p>
