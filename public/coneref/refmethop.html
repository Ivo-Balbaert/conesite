    <div class="text">

	<p>Many operators are implemented as method calls. For instance, <span class="pre">x+3</span>
		is treated as if it were:  <span class="pre">x.`+`(3)</span>
		A type need only implement the <span class="pre">`+`</span> method to
		make the <span class="pre">+</span> operator meaningful to values of that type.
		If a program tries to apply the <span class="pre">+</span> operator to a value 
		whose type has not implemented the <span class="pre">`+`</span> method,
		a compiler error results.</p>
	<p>Let's explore the implications across a number of operators.</p>

	<h2>Arithmetic Operator Methods</h2>
	<p>A type may support any of the <a href="refexpr.html#arith">arithmetic operators</a>
		(<span class="pre">+</span>, <span class="pre">-</span>, <span class="pre">*</span>,
		<span class="pre">/</span> and <span class="pre">%</span>) 
		by implementing them as methods.
		The integer and floating point types do this, of course,
		but really any type that effectively encodes numbers or number structures can do this.
		This might include: complex numbers, "big" integers, rationals, unit-based numbers, vectors or matrices.</p>
		<p>On the previous page, the <span class="pre">Point</span> type example
		took advamtage of this by implementing the subtraction method:</p>
<pre>
fn `-`(pt2) Point
	Point[pt2.x - x, pt2.y - y]
</pre>
	<p><b>Note:</b> Whenever a name includes non-alphanumeric (or underscore) characters,
		it must be enclosed in backticks. This is why the method name is shown as
		<span class="pre">`-`</span>.</p>
	<p>With this method implemented, one may simply subtract two Points in an expression:
		<span class="pre">pt1 - pt2</span>.</p>
	<p>Unary negation may also be implemented using the <span class="pre">`-`</span>.
		The difference between the negation method and the subtraction method is that
		the former needs only the self parameter:</p>
<pre>
fn `-`() Point
  Point[-x, -y]
</pre>
	
	<h3>Arithmetic Assignment Operators</h3>
	<p>A custom type may also support any of the <a href="refexpr.html#arithassign">arithmetic assignment operators</a>
		(<span class="pre">+=</span>, <span class="pre">-=</span>, <span class="pre">*=</span>,
		<span class="pre">/=</span> and <span class="pre">%=</span>) 
		by implementing them as methods.</p>
	<p>If a type does not implement the arithmetic assignment operators,
		the compiler will attempt to implement them using the arithmetic methods.
		Thus, <span class="pre">pt1 += pt2</span> would be treated as if it were:
		<span class="pre">pt1 = pt1 + 2</span>.</p>

	<h3>Increment and Decrement Operators</h3>
	<p>A type may implement the <a href="refexpr.html#incrdecr">increment or decrement operators</a>
			(<span class="pre">++</span> and <span class="pre">--</span>) as methods.
			When used as prefix operators, their names are <span class="pre">`++`</span> and <span class="pre">`--`</span>.
			When used as postfix operators, their names are
			<span class="pre">`_++`</span> and <span class="pre">`_--`</span>.
	</p>

	<h2>Logic and Shift Operator Methods</h2>
	<p>A type may support any of the <a href="refexpr.html#bitwise">logic and shift operators</a>
		(<span class="pre">!</span>, <span class="pre">&</span>, <span class="pre">^</span>,
		<span class="pre">~</span>, <span class="pre">&lt;&lt;</span> and <span class="pre">&gt;&gt;</span>) 
		by implementing them as methods.</p>
	<p>Similarly, the logic an shift assignment operators may also be implemented as methods.
		If not, they will be handled in the same way as the arithmetic assignment operators.</p>
	
	<h2 id="compare">Comparison Operator Methods</h2>
	<p>To support operator-based comparison of two values, implement the appropriate
		<a href="refif.html#compare">comparison operator(s)</a>
		(<span class="pre">==</span>, <span class="pre">&lt;</span>, <span class="pre">&lt;=</span>,
		<span class="pre">&gt;</span>, or <span class="pre">&gt;=</span>) 
		as methods.
		It is not necessary to implement the inequivalence operator (<span class="pre">!=</span>),
		as this is supported automatically if <span class="pre">`==`</span> is implemented.
	</p>

	<h2>'set' Methods for Assignment</h2>
	<p>To implement methods that work to the left of the assignment operator,
		use a <span class="pre">set</span> method.
		Such methods are designated by preceding <span class="pre">fn</span> with <span class="pre">set</span>.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
struct Counter
  _count u32 = 0
  set fn count(cnt u32)
    _count = cnt / 2
</pre>
	<p>As this example demonstrates, a <span class="pre">set</span> method typically alters
		some private field's value using a formula or algorithm.
		We can make use of this method as follows:</p>
<pre>
mut cnt = Counter[]
cnt.count() = 10    // Sets _count to 5
cnt.count = 6       // Note: the parentheses can be omitted
</pre>
	<p>The value to the right of the assignment is passed to the
		<span class="pre">set</span> method as the last argument.</p>

	<h3>Getters and Setters</h3>
	<p>For public fields, there is often no reason to implement getters and setters to offer
		direct access to their values.
		However, if it would be unsafe to offer direct access to certain fields,
		in order to preserve specific data invariants, one should make them private
		and then potentially offer appropriate getters and setters that preserve the invariants.</p>
 	<p>Implementing a getter and setter is as easy as defining a
		a regular and <span class="pre">set</span> method of the same name:</p>
<pre>
struct Counter
	_count u32 = 0

  // a getter
  fn counter() u32
    _count++

  // a setter
  set fn count(cnt u32)
    _count = cnt
</pre>
	<p>And here we use them:</p>
<pre>
mut x = Counter[]
x.counter // 0
x.counter // 1
x.counter = 10 // uses the "setter" to set the value
x.counter // 10
</pre>
  <p>Because we can omit the parentheses when using a getter or setter,
		their use looks no different than access to a public field.
		This makes it possible to start off with a type making a field public,
		and then later changing it to private because of an invariant.
		By implementing getters and setters instead, the API can be preserved
		even as the implementation evolves.</p>

	<h2>Collection Operators</h2>
	<p>By wrapping an array (or array reference) within a struct, one can
		create all sorts of collections: indexed collections like vectors and dictionaries,
		as well as stacks, queues, sets and more.
		The difference between them is largely determined by which methods are implemented for
		working with various elements of the collection.
		Most collections will typically implement the
		<span class="pre">len</span> method to find how many elements are currently in the collection,
		and <span class="pre">iter</span> to enable iteration through the collection's elements.</p>
	<p>A couple of operators make it easier to work with collections:
		<span class="pre">[]</span> for indexed access and
		<span class="pre">&lt;-</span> to add or remove an element.
		Each collection type implements methods that determine how these operators work.</p>

	<h3>[] Indexed Access Operator</h3>
	<p>As we saw with arrays, the <span class="pre">[]</span> operator is used to
		access a specific collection element according to its index.
		Implementing the <span class="pre">[]</span> method as both a getter and setter
		makes indexed access possible for other kinds of indexed collections.
		The index need not even be an unsigned integer, as it is for an array.
		Dictionaries, for example, often use strings as the index.</p>

	<h3>&lt;- Add Element Operator</h3>
	<p>A collection may implement the <span class="pre">&lt;-</span> operator
		for adding an element to a collection, typically the end of it.</p>
	The corresponding method has <span class="pre">self</span> and the element as parameters.
	If an array literal is used on the right-hand side of the
	<span class="pre">&lt;-</span> operator, all of its elements are added to the
	collection on the left, one-by-one.</p>
		
	<h2>() "Function call" Operator</h2>
	<p>It is actually possible to "call" an object as if it were a function.
		Doing so will actually invoke the <span class="pre">()</span> method
		for the object.
		This is what makes it possibe to support 
		<a href="refclosure.html">closures</a>.</p>

	<h2>Initializers and Finalizers</h2>
	<p>A type may define one or more <b>initializers</b>.
		Initializers offer an alternative to the type constructor
		to create a new value of that type.
		In contrast to a type constructor, which uses square brackets, an initializer uses parentheses:</p>
<pre>
imm pt = Point(1.)
</pre>
	<p>The default name for initializers is <span class="pre">init</span>. 
		An initializer may, however, use some other name.
		In particuar, an initializer named <span class="pre">clone</span>
		is automatically used (when defined) whenever
		a copy of a value needs to be made due to assignment, function call parameters, etc.</p>
	<p>A type may also define a single <b>finalizer</b> called <span class="pre">drop</span>.
		This is automatically invoked immediately before any value of that type is destroyed,
		and its memory space reclaimed.</p>
	<p>On a later page, detailed advice is given 
		on how to <a href="refinitdrop.html">define initializers and finalizers</a>.</p>
