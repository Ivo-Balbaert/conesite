	<p>Although Cone provides a rich collection of standard allocators, there are times that
		other allocators can prove valuable. For example:
		such as rc allocators that use tracing to break cycles or 
		multi-threaded garbage collectors that use tracing for intrathread memory management and ref counting
		for inter-thread memory management (Pony's Orca).</p>
		<p>This is why Cone supports the creation and use of custom allocators. 
	Definition of a new allocator looks and acts very much like a struct with methods.
	For example:</p>
<pre>
// A simple reference counting allocator
alloc rc
  refcnt usize

  fn allocate(size usize) *uni rc
    imm rcref = malloc(size) as *uni rc
    rcref.refcnt = 1
    rcref
  fn alias(self *mutx rc)
    .refcnt += 1
  fn dealias(self *mutx rc)
    .refcnt -= 1
    if .refcnt == 0
      .free()
  fn free(self *mutx rc)
    free(self as *u8)
</pre>
	<p>As this example shows, an allocator typically defines at least these four methods
	which are invoked automatically by the compiler based on key events in the lifetime of an allocated reference:
	<ul>
	<li><b>allocate</b>. This is invoked whenever a new allocated reference is created using the &amp; operator.
	The compiler supplies the sizeof the appropriate type of value to be stored in the allocated memory.
	This size is expanded to include runtime bookkeeping data for the allocator (e.g., refcnt) and permission.
	After allocate, the compiler will also initialize any runtime permission's fields, if needed.
	The compiler's final step is to adjust the pointer to point at the value's data (past the runtime bookkeeping data),
	and then to initialize its value based on the literal, initializer or a copy of another similar value.</li>
	<li><b>alias</b>. This is invoked whenever a new shared copy is made of the reference.</li>
	<li><b>dealias</b>. This is invoked whenever an allocated reference is destroyed, typically when
	the variable holding the reference reaches the end of its lexical lifetime.
	It can also happen when overwriting a reference held by an existing variable or field.</li>
	<li><b>free</b>. This is invoked whenever the allocator determines the value is safe to free.
	Before executing its logic, the compiler will invoke the drop method on the object, if it exist,
	which serves as a finalizer for any resources obtained by the allocated reference.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Any allocator which does not define the alias method (e.g., the 'own' allocator)
	ensures single-owner <a href="refmove.html">move semantics</a>,
	as it prevents multiple copies of the reference from being created.
	The single-owner reference is moved instead of being copied.
	This restriction also constrains the permissions on borrowed references,
	effectively disallowing <span class="pre">mut</span> and all other shared mutable permissions.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, an allocator may also define the alias method which performs no logic (e.g., the gc allocator).
	In this case, multiple, sharable references to the same value become possible.</p>
	<p>Notice also that allocators work with pointers (which have no assigned allocator).
	All allocator methods are considered wrapped as trust blocks, which allows the use of pointers
	as well as trusted functions like malloc() and free().
	The pointers are automatically and correctly cast by the compiler back and forth
	from the correct pointer to the correct reference.</p>
