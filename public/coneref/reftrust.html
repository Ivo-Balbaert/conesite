	<p>Safety is enriched when the programmer and the compiler work together
		towards that end, each bringing different gifts to bear on the problem.
		The compiler's gift is its obsessive ability to detect every time code
		breaks its declared constraints.
		This is manifested in the compiler's built-in guard rails for protecting your code
		against a number of common safety hazards.
		However, the compiler can only quickly check a small collection of very-simplistic rules;
		it has no intelligence to detect when rule-breaking code is still 100% safe.
		The compiler is trying to be helpful, but is just getting in the way!</p>
	<p>This is where we rely on the programmer's gift 
		(and ultimate responsibility) to figure this out,
		using techniques more sophisticated than simple safety rules.
		In such situations, Cone provides a built-in escape hatch from some of the 
		over-anxious compiler's guard rails, in the form of an annotation. 
		By preceding any any expression or block with <span class="pre">trust</span> 
		(as in:  "trust me on this"), several safety checks are turned off,
		thereby allowing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Raw pointer</b> dereferences, arithmetic, and re-casts.
			This provides a way to bypass the safety constraints imposed on references
			by permissions, lifetimes, regions and bounds-checks.
			On the <a href="refptr.html">next page</a>, 
			we'll explore this.</li>
		<li><b>extern function</b> calls.
			This is normally restricted, as Cone has no way to assure that some other language
			has been as rigorous in verifying the safety of their function logic.
			We'll explore this when introducing <a href="refinclude.html#extern">extern</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Type reinterpretation</b>, where Cone has no way to know that
			the re-cast value is being safely digested.</li>
		<li><b>Non-discriminated unions</b> field access, where Cone has no way to know
			what disciminant to pattern match against.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>By using this "trust" mechanism, compiler-unverifiable code can be
		isolated and highlighted as such, while still acknowledging
		that the programmer, who has the ultimate responsibility for safety,
		may very clearly see what the compiler cannot.</p>

	<h2>Type Reinterpretation</h2>
	<p>Reinterpretation takes some existing encoded value and allows
		it to be re-cast and manipulated as if it were 
		a value of a different, but same-sized type.
		For example, we can use re-interpretation to explicitly
		coerce a non-nullable reference to a nullable one:</p>
<pre>
imm nullref = someref as ?&i32
</pre>
	<p>Reinterpretation uses the <span class="pre">as</span> operator.
		Unlike other operators, <span class="pre">as</span> expects a type
		to the right of the operator.</p>
	<p>Unless the re-interpretation represents a legal coercion,
		its use could pose a risk to type safety.
		A value could behave badly when treated and manipulated
		within the constraints of a different type.</p>
	<p>When Cone is unsure of the risk, it requires use of
		<span class="pre">trust</span> to reassure it that the reinterpretation is safe.
		Use of this keyword marks that the programmer knows and accepts
		the reponsibility for handling it in a safe and useful way.
		For example, re-interpreting a nullable reference as non-nullable
		without a visible check for null-ness requires such reassurance:</p>
<pre>
imm someref = trust {nullref as &i32}
</pre>
	<p>Although reinterpretation is mostly used with references and pointers,
		other valid uses are possible.
		For example, a IEEE 754-compliant floating-point number can be
		reinterpreted as an unsigned integer to get direct access
		to its encoded bits:</p>
<pre>
imm signbit = Bool[trust {pi as u64} >> 63]
</pre>
	<p>This sort of capability is needed to safely build advanced
		floating point functions not supported by the CPU,
		such as trigonometric operations.</p>

	<h2>Unions</h2>
	<p>A union provides similar capability to enums and variant types.
		However, since it does explicitly designate a discriminant
		unable to verify that the appropriate pattern match was done
		prior to accessing a union's field.
		<span class="pre">trust</span> is the programmers way to
		tell the compiler not to worry here:</p>
<pre>
union Value
  nbr usize
  ref &usize
	
fn getInt(v Value) usize trust
  if (v.nbr & 3 == 0)
    *v.ref
  else
    v.nbr>>2
</pre>
	<p>As this example shows, the entire function block can be marked as trustworthy.</p>
