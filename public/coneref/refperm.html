	<p>The primary role of permissions is to improve program safety by preventing race conditions,
	where multiple concurrent threads step on each other when trying to access the same value.
	Prudent use of permissions can also help make code easier to understand and improve execution performance.</p>
	<p>Every variable, field and reference declares its permission,
	which enables and constrains its use.
	For example, different permissions grant or deny the right to read a value, modify a value, 
	share references to the same value, or share access to values across threads.</p>
	<p>Permissions come in two flavors:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Static permissions are completely enforced when the program is compiled,
	Since they need no runtime enforcement mechanisms, they do not slow down a program.
	There are a fixed number of these built-in, static permissions.</li>
	<li>Runtime permissions are enforced partly by the compiler and partly by runtime mechanisms.
	It is possible to define additional runtime permissions beyond those provided by the language.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>imm and mut</h2>
	<p>These two static permissions were introduced in an earlier chapter.
	Most variable and struct field declarations use one of these two permissions:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><span class="pre">imm</span> (immutable)
	declares that a variable or reference's value will never change after it is initialized.
	Multiple threads may share access to immutable values.</li>
	<li><span class="pre">mut</span> (mutable)
	allows multiple references and/or variables to access or change a specific value.
	However, all references to such values are restricted to a single thread.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>uni</h2>
	<p>The static <span class="pre">uni</span> (unique) permission
	allows its protected value to be read or changed (similar to <span class="pre">mut</span>).
	However, it carries a significant restriction:
	there can only be one active reference to its value at a time.
	Ownership of such a reference may be moved around, including (importantly) to another thread.</p>
	<p>The <span class="pre">uni</span> permission, and its single reference restriction,
	may seem a bit unusual. However, the concept is not new to Cone.
	Rust's &mut reference, Pony's iso reference capability, and C's restrict keyword accomplish something similar.
	Let's explore the implications of using this permission.</p>
	
	<h3>uni as the first permission</h3>
	<p><span class="pre">uni</span> is best understood as
	the first permission an allocator reference gets in the early days of its existence.
	Whenever a type constructor creates and returns a new allocator reference, 
	it typically has the <span class="pre">uni</span> permission.
	This makes sense: since the just-created reference is the only one in existence, 
	it naturally complies with the single reference restriction.</p>
	<p>So long as the reference keeps its <span class="pre">uni</span> permission,
	this single reference to an object can be freely and safely moved around a program,
	hopping from function-to-function or even thread-to-thread.
	When a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference is assigned to another variable or
	passed to a function (or returned), the reference moves to its new owner.
	Any subsequent attempt to use the previous owner of the reference will trigger an error:
<pre>
imm ref = &gc Point{x: 1.0, y: 3.0} // Create new object and reference
imm newref = ref   // Move reference to newref
imm x = ref.x      // ERROR! ref is no longer usable
</pre>

	<h3>uni as the universal donor</h3>
	<p>In many cases, the single reference restriction of <span class="pre">uni</span>
	poses no hardship and the reference keeps its <span class="pre">uni</span>
	permission throughout the object's lifetime.
	In addition to flexibility of movement, there can be 
	other benefits to keeping a mutable reference as <span class="pre">uni</span>,
	such as improved performance optimizations and sum type safety.</p>
	<p>However, the single reference restriction makes <span class="pre">uni</span> references unsuitable for
	many data structures that require the use of multiple references to the same object.
	Should a program's logic need multiple references to the same object,
	the <span class="pre">uni</span> reference may be transitioned to a new reference with a sharable permission, 
	such as <span class="pre">mut</span> or <span class="pre">imm</span>:
<pre>
imm ref = &amp;gc Point{x: 1.0, y: 3.0} // Create new object and reference
imm newref1 &amp;mut = ref      // Move reference to newref with 'mut' permission
imm newref2 &amp;mut = newref1  // Two 'mut' references to the same object
imm x = newref1.x      // Either reference may be used
</pre>
	<p>This transition may be more concisely performed at reference creation:</p>
<pre>
imm newref1 = &amp;gc mut Point{x: 1.0, y: 3.0} // Create new 'mut' reference
</pre>

	<h3>uni and temporary transitions</h3>
	<p>In many cases, the transition from <span class="pre">uni</span> to a shared reference is a one way trip.
	You cannot safely transition a <span class="pre">mut</span> reference back to a
	<span class="pre">uni</span> reference (or even to an <span class="pre">imm</span> reference).
	The reference is now "frozen" to the restrictions of its new permission:
	As <span class="pre">mut</span>, it can never be shared across threads.
	As <span class="pre">imm</span>, it can never be altered.</p>
	<p>Using borrowed references, however, it becomes possible to temporarily transition
	a reference to another permission. 
	During the lifetime of a borrowed reference, the original <span class="pre">uni</span> reference may not be used.
	However, once the lexical lifetime of the borrowed reference expires,
	the original <span class="pre">uni</span> reference becomes usable again:</p>
<pre>
imm ref = &amp;gc Point {x: 1, y: 2}
  imm ref2 = &amp;mut ref
  imm ref3 = ref2
  ref2.x = ref3.y
  ref.y = 5    // Error, ref is unusable while borrowed 'ref2' exists
ref.x = 5      // Allowed, since borrowed references have expired
</pre>
	
	<h2>const</h2>
	<p>The <span class="pre">const</span> (constant) permission is valuable for temporary references,
	particularly borrowed references.
	Although a <span class="pre">const</span> reference may read its value, modification is prohibited.
	Although this restriction sounds like <span class="pre">imm</span>,
	there are key differences.
	<span class="pre">imm</span> guarantees that no other mutable reference to the same object exists,
	making it safe to share between threads. <span class="pre">const</span> makes no such guarantee.
	Therefore, <span class="pre">const</span> references cannot be safely shared with another thread.</p>
	<p>The primary value of <span class="pre">const</span> lies with references passed to functions and methods
	which need to inspect the reference's value but promise to never try to change it.
	By declaring a reference parameter as <span class="pre">const</span>,
	the function or method can safely accept references that are declared as
	<span class="pre">mut</span>, <span class="pre">imm</span>, <span class="pre">uni</span>,
	<span class="pre">const</span>, or <span class="pre">mutx</span>.</p>
	<p>Because <span class="pre">const</span> is such a common and universal receiver for
	other references, a new reference is assumed to have <span class="pre">const</span> permission
	when no permission has been explicitly specified.</p>

	<h2>mutx</h2>
	<p>For borrowed references, the <span class="pre">mutx</span> permission
	is the mutable counterpart of <span class="pre">const</span>.
	A <span class="pre">mutx</span> reference may inspect or change its value.
	During its lifetime, it promises that references borrowed from it are either
	a) multiple <span class="pre">const</span> references
	or b) a single usable <span class="pre">mutx</span> reference.
	<span class="pre">mutx</span> may not be shared or moved across threads.</p>
	<p><span class="pre">mutx</span> is typically the best permission to specify when a function or method
	needs a reference able to change its value.
	This is because <span class="pre">mutx</span> can safely accept references that are declared as
	<span class="pre">mut</span>, <span class="pre">uni</span>, or <span class="pre">mutx</span>.
	By contrast, a borrowed reference declared as <span class="pre">mut</span>
	would not be able accept linear allocator references, 
	references to sum types, or <span class="pre">mutx</span> references.</p>
	
	<h4>mutx for sum type allocator references</h4>
	<p><span class="pre">mutx</span> may also be used on allocator references.
	Its main purpose is to allow multiple references to a value that guarantee
	that only one can modify the value at a time and only via a <span class="pre">mutx</span> borrowed reference.
	This can be useful when a program needs multiple mutable allocator references to sum types which,
	for safety reasons, may never be <span class="pre">mut</span>.</p>
	<p>Sum types, variable-sized arrays and other types need restrictions on shared mutability for memory safety,
	even in single-threaded situations. 
	Otherwise, it might be possible for one reference to alter the structure of the object
	while another reference holds an interior pointer now invalidated by the structural change.
	Unsafe things could happen if the interior pointer was then used.</p>
	<p>Enforcement of this guarantee requires a run-time mechanism.
	As with all runtime permissions, this means that
	<span class="pre">mutx</span> <b>must</b> be specified as the permission
	when allocating the first reference to that value.</p>

	<h2>id</h2>
	<p><span class="pre">id</span> (identifier)
	declares that this reference will never be used to read or modify its value.
	It may only be compared with another reference.
	It may be derived (coerced) from any reference.
	Its primary value is for references to actors, thereby enabling invocation of an actor's behaviors
	without the ability to see or change its state.</p>

	<h2>Runtime (Synchronization) Permissions</h2>
	<p>In addition to the static permissions, Cone also offers runtime permissions.
	Runtime permissions enable the use of shared, mutable references that are not limited by 
	the restrictions placed on <span class="pre">mut</span> references.
	Using runtime permissions, it becomes possible to share value references across threads
	or to obtain interior references to shared references on sum or array types.</p>
	<p>The penalty for this added freedom is that reference use carries a small runtime performance hit.
	This is because runtime permissions wrap every use of the reference to access its contents
	with that runtime permission's synchronization mechanism
	which ensures that only one reference at a time can read or change its value.
	The other potential drawback is that use of runtime permissions 
	can sometimes suffer from deadlocks or runtime panics.</p>
	
	<h3>Runtime Permission Coercions</h3>
	<p>Runtime permissions do not allow coercion to or from any other permission.
	Thus, the runtime permission must be specified when creating a new allocator reference to a value.
	All copies of that reference carry the same permission.</p>
	<p>This means that objects protected by runtime permissions cannot use functions
	that accept <span class="pre">const</span> or <span class="pre">mutx</span> references.
	They can only use functions whose reference parameters declare the same runtime permission.</p>
	
	<h3>Lock</h3>
	<p>The Lock permission enables multiple, mutable references to be shared and used across threads.
	It makes use of hardware intrinsics to ensure only one reference at a time can
	read or modify the contents of the reference.</p>
<pre>
imm point &amp;Lock Point = &amp;Gc Lock Point(x:2, y: 3)
thread.sendPoint(point)  // Now another thread has a copy of this reference
point.x += point.y  // Access to point safely protected by Lock twice
</pre>
	
	<h3>Custom Permissions</h3>
	<p>It is possible to define additional runtime permissions ... TBD</p>
<pre>
perm NewLock
  ....
</pre>
	
	<h2>Permissions and Threads</h2>
	<p>Only <span class="pre">imm</span>, <span class="pre">id</span>,
	and the runtime "locked" permissions may be shared freely between threads.
	Furthermore, a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference may be 
	moved from one thread to another. References with any other permission
	(<span class="pre">mut</span>, <span class="pre">const</span>, and <span class="pre">mutx</span>)
	restrict access to their values to a single thread.</p>
	
	<h2>Permissions and Struct fields</h3>
	<p>TBD</p>
