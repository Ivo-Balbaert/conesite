	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: Although most of these permissions are supported,
			only mutability and coercion are enforced.</i></p>
	
	<p>Every reference's type specifies a permission which controls
		what may, and may not, be done with that reference.
		Permissions affect such capabilities as the reference's right to 
		view (or modify) the value it points to,
		create multiple copies of that reference, 
		and use locks or atomics for synchronizing access to the reference's value.</p>
	<p>The primary purpose of permissions is to improve program safety by preventing data races,
		where multiple concurrent threads step on each other when trying to access the same value.
		Each permission uses a different strategy to make it impossible for multiple
		threads to perform lifetime-overlapping atomic transactions on the same value.
		For some of these permissions, their guarantees can be enforced entirely by the compiler,
		which means they are free from runtime overhead.
		Others are enforced by a combination of compiler and runtime mechanisms
		(e.g., locks).</p>
	<p>Prudent use of permissions can also help make code easier to understand and improve execution performance.</p>

	<h2>List of Permissions</h2>
	<p>Let's introduce each permission, one at a time.</p>
	
	<h3 id="uni">uni</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">uni</span> (unique) permission is quite permissive.
		It may be used to view or mutate the value it points to.
		It may hop safely from thread to thread without any runtime penalty,
		making it the fastest way to move mutable data from one thread to another.</p>
	<p>The name, "unique", signals its one restriction:
		there can only be <i>one</i> active reference to its value at a time.
		Because of this, its use is governed by	<a href="refmove.html">move semantics</a>.
		The reference may be moved to another variable, function, or thread,
		but doing so makes it inaccessible at its former home.</p>
<pre>
imm ref = &so 5    // uni is the default permission for owning reference
imm newref = ref   // Move uni-based reference to newref
imm x = ref.x      // ERROR! ref is no longer usable, as its value moved to newref
</pre>
	<p><span class="pre">uni</span> is the default permission on an owning reference,
		if no permission is explicitly specified.</p>
	<p><span class="pre">uni</span> is ideal when we never need multiple owning references to the same value
		(a situation that would also benefit by using the <span class="pre">so</span> region).
		<span class="pre">uni</span> is also valuable when multiple, owning references are not needed
		early in the lifetime of the object, but we do want it to be able to move from thread to thread.
		Performance optimization benefits
		may also result from knowing the reference is unique.</p>

	<h3>imm</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">imm</span> (immutable) permission 
		declares that a reference's value will never change after it is initialized.
		Multiple references may point to the same immutable value,
		even across multiple threads.
		An <span class="pre">imm</span> reference may view its value,
		but not alter it.</p>

	<h3>mut</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">mut</span> (mutable) permission
		allows multiple references to freely access or change the same value at any time.
		However, all references to the same value are restricted to a single thread.</p>
	<p>A <span class="pre">mut</span> array reference may not re-size its array.
		Similarly, a <span class="pre">mut</span> reference may not alter a variant value.</p>

	<h3 id="const">const</h3>
	<p>A <span class="pre">const</span> reference may read, but not modify, the value it points to.
		This may sound like <span class="pre">imm</span>, but it is not the same.
		<span class="pre">imm</span> guarantees that <i>no</i> other mutable reference to the same object exists,
		making it safe to share between threads. 
		<span class="pre">const</span> makes no such guarantee.
		Therefore, <span class="pre">const</span> references cannot be safely shared with another thread.</p>
	<p>The primary use for <span class="pre">const</span> rests in how it 
		allows a function to take in a reference of 
		<a href="#toconst">nearly any permission</a>,
		simply by promising not to change the value the reference points at.
		This polymorphic flexibility is why a borrowed reference's default permission
		is <span class="pre">const</span>, if no permission is explicitly specified.</p>
	
	<h3>mutex</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">mutex</span> permission 
		enables multiple, mutable references to be shared across threads.
		A <span class="pre">mutex</span> reference itself 
		cannot directly access or change the value it points to,
		except by using atomic operations.</p>
	<p>To obtain direct access to the value, one must first obtain a 
		<a href="refborref.html">borrowed reference</a>
		from the <span class="pre">mutex</span> reference.
		Obtaining the borrowed reference automatically acquires a runtime lock
		that ensures only one reference at a time can 
		view or modify the value the reference points to.</p>
<pre>
imm point = &amp;gc mutex Point(x:2, y: 3)
do
  pointref = &mut *point     // Obtain borrowed ref to unlock access to the point
  pointref.x += pointref.y   // Access to point safely protected by mutex
</pre>
	<p>When the borrowed reference expires, so does the acquired lock.</p>

	<h3>rwlock</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">rwlock</span> permission
		works very much the same way as <span class="pre">mutex</span>,
		except that it allows multiple read-only borrowed references to be obtained
		at the same time. 
		However, only one mutable borrowed reference may be obtained at a time.</p>

	<h3>rwcell</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">rwcell</span> permission
		is quite similar to <span class="pre">rwlock</span>,
		except that all its reference copies are constrained to say in a single thread.
		This is useful when one withes to serialize at runtime the acquisition
		of interior references to variant or collection values.</p>
		
	<h3>opaq</h3>
	<p>An <span class="pre">opaq</span> (opaque) reference
	may never be used to read or modify the value it points to.
	This restriction is useful for references to functions or
	<a href="refstruct.html#opaque">opaque</a> values,
	where it makes no sense to access the value they point to.</p>

	<h2>Variable vs. Reference Permissions</h2>
	<p>Initially, it may feel confusing,  distinguishing the role of
		a permission on a reference vs. on a <a href="refterm.html#varperm">variable</a>,
		particularly if the variable holds a reference.
		Quite simply, a <b>variable</b>'s permission governs whether you can give
		the variable a new value.
		A <b>reference</b>'s permission governs what you can do with the reference.
		These are separable concerns.</p>
	<p>To illustrate this, consider these variations:</p>
<pre>
imm ref1 = &amp;rc imm 3
imm ref2 = &amp;rc mut 3
mut ref3 = &amp;rc imm 3
mut ref4 = &amp;rc mut 3
</pre>
	<p>Because of the <span class="pre">mut</span> variable permission,
	<span class="pre">ref3</span> and <span class="pre">ref4</span>
	may be changed to hold a different reference.
	<span class="pre">ref1</span> and <span class="pre">ref2</span> cannot.
</p>
<pre>
ref1 = &amp;rc imm 5   // ** ILLEGAL! **
ref2 = &amp;rc mut 5   // ** ILLEGAL! **
ref3 = &amp;rc imm 5   // ok
ref4 = &amp;rc mut 5   // ok
</pre>
	<p>In contrast, because of the <span class="pre">mut</span> reference permission,
	the references in <span class="pre">ref2</span> and <span class="pre">ref4</span>
	may be changed to point to a different value.
	The values pointed to by <span class="pre">ref1</span> and <span class="pre">ref3</span> cannot be altered.
</p>
<pre>
*ref1 = 5   // ** ILLEGAL! **
*ref2 = 5   // ok
*ref3 = 5   // ** ILLEGAL! **
*ref4 = 5   // ok
</pre>

<h2>Permission Transitions</h2>
	<p>A new copy of a reference typically has the same permission as the
		original reference, which is often necessary to preserve the reference's safety guarantees.
		In certain cases, however, we may safely create a
		reference copy carrying a different permission.</p>

	<h3>From 'uni'</h3>
	<p>At some point in the lifetime of a	<span class="pre">uni</span> reference's value, 
		one may need to transition to allowing multiple, shared references to that value.
		On a temporary basis (for some lexical lifetime), this transition may be accomplished
		by using <a href="refborref.html#permtrans">borrowed references</a>.</p>
	<p>It is also possible to permanently transition a
		<span class="pre">uni</span> reference to references holding shared permissions,
		such as <span class="pre">mut</span> or <span class="pre">imm</span>.
		This is accomplished by moving the `uni` reference value to
		a reference that holds a shared permission.
		The original <span class="pre">uni</span> reference is consumed (because of move semantics),
		leaving us with a new sharable reference, from which copies can be made.</p>		
<pre>
imm ref = &amp;rc 5                 // Allocate new value, return 'uni' reference
imm newref1 &amp;mut i32 = ref      // Move reference to newref with 'mut' permission
imm newref2 &amp;mut i32 = newref1  // Two 'mut' references to the same object
*newref2 = *newref1             // Either reference may be used (but not ref any longer)
</pre>
	<p>The transition of an owning reference
		from <span class="pre">uni</span> to a shared permission reference is a one way trip.
		Once this transition has happened,
		you cannot safely transition a <span class="pre">mut</span> reference back to a
		<span class="pre">uni</span> reference (or even to an <span class="pre">imm</span> reference).
		The reference is now "frozen" to the restrictions of its new permission:
		As <span class="pre">mut</span>, it can never be shared across threads.
		As <span class="pre">imm</span>, it can never be altered.</p>

	<h3 id="toconst">To 'const'</h3>
	<p>It is safe to create a <span class="pre">const</span> copy of any 
		<span class="pre">mut</span> or <span class="pre">imm</span> owning reference.
		Even better, it is safe to borrow a <span class="pre">const</span>
		reference from a reference of any permission other than <span class="pre">opaq</span>.
		This quality is what makes it attractive for functions to polymorphically
		accept <span class="pre">const</span> references to any values
		they do not intend to modify.</p>

	<h2 id="view">When Type Fields are References</h3>
	<p>If a type has a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference field,
		values of that type are likely also governed by move semantics.</p>
	<p>If a type defines a reference field whose permission stops it from
		being shared across multiple threads
		(<span class="pre">mut</span>, <span class="pre">const</span>
		and <span class="pre">rwcell</span>), 
		values of that type (and references to values of that type) 
		are also prevented from being shared across multiple threads.</p>
	<p>If we have a reference that prohibits mutation of its pointed-at value,
		that mutability restriction also applies to any reference fields it holds,
		even if they might otherwise allow mutation of their values.</p>
