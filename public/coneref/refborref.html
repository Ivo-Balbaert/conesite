	<p>Borrowed references are borrowed from a variable or some other reference.
	They have no idea what allocator created the object
	and are able to point to substructures within compound objects.
	This flexibility makes them ideal for passing information to general-purpose functions or methods.
	However, the lifetime of a borrowed reference is constrained;
	it cannot outlive the variable or reference it borrowed from.</p>
	<p>Use of a borrowed reference typically focuses only on the object it references.
	In fact, a reference is often implicitly understood to just be a stand-in for the object it references.
	Strict safety rules ensure that references always refer to a valid object of the right type.</p>
	<p>Here's a simple example that shows a borrowed reference being created and used.
	The <span class="pre">&</span> operator obtains a reference to a variable's contents.
	The <span class="pre">*</span> operator accesses the contents referred to by a reference:</p>
<pre>
imm a = 3
imm ref = &amp;a    // ref holds a reference to a's contents
imm val = *ref  // val is now 3
</pre>

	<h2>Borrowed Reference Type Declarations</h2>
	<p>Similar to numbers and structures, references are value types.
	Mirroring the <span class="pre">&amp;</span> operator used to create a reference,
	a borrowed reference declaration begins with <span class="pre">&amp;</span>,
	followed by the reference's permission, lifetime (optional),
	and the value type of the object being referred to.</p>
<pre>
imm ptr2 &amp;mut Coord
imm ptr3 &amp;Coord       // omitted permission is 'const'
</pre>
	<p>The <span class="pre">const</span> permission is the default given to a borrowed reference when none is specified.
	<span class="pre">const</span> grants a reference the ability to view the contents of the object but not change it.</p>
	<p>Borrowed references may be declared for:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>variables</b>. Due to type inference, explicit reference declarations 
	are typically unnecessary on variable declarations that specify an initial value.</li>
	<li><b>struct</b> (or similar) fields or elements.
	The presence of one or more references in a <span class="pre">struct</span>
	may prevent it from being implicitly copied on assignment, unless it implements the .clone method.</li>
	<li><b>function parameters and return value(s)</b>
	Functions typically require explicit declaration of references on parameters or return values:
	For example:</p>
<pre>
// next takes a reference and returns a number
fn next(x &amp;i32) i32
  *x + 1

fn caller()
  imm a = 3
  next(&amp;a)  // gets back 4
</pre>
	<p>A lifetype annotation may occasionally be necessary within function signatures.
	See <a href="#lifetime">Lifetime Annotations</a> for more information.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Creating Borrowed References</h2>
	<p>Borrowed references may be borrowed from:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>a global variable, local variable or parameter:
<pre>
imm glovar = 2
fn func(imm parm)
  imm localvar = 3
  imm ref1 = &amp;glovar
  imm ref2 = &amp;parm
  imm ref3 = &amp;localvar
</pre></li>
	<li>another borrowed reference.
<pre>
imm ref1 = &amp;glovar
imm ref2 = &amp;ref1
imm ref3 = ref1  // or one can simply copy the reference
</pre></li>
	<li>an allocator reference.
<pre>
imm apoint = &amp;gc mut Point{x: 0f, y: 1f}
imm borrow = &amp;apoint   // without the &amp;, this would create another allocator reference
</pre></li>
	<li>a substructure within some variable or reference:
<pre>
imm ref1 = &amp;apoint.x   // a field within a struct
imm ref2 = &amp;vec[a]     // a slice within an array
// TBD // pattern matching a sum typed value's contents
</pre></li>
</ul>
	
	<h3>Permission</h3>
	<p>If a borrowed reference requires some other permission than <span class="pre">const</span>,
	specify it following the <span class="pre">&amp;</span>.</p>
<pre>
mut a = 3
imm ref = &amp;mut a  // ref holds a mutable reference to a's contents
imm val = *ref    // val is now 3
*ref = 10         // a is now 10. val is still 3.
</pre>
	<p>Note that the permission specified for a borrowed reference may not exceed the permission granted
	to the variable or reference it borrowed from. 
	Thus, you cannot get a <span class="pre">mut</span> reference from an <span class="pre">imm</span> variable.</p>
	<p>Also notice that the <i>variable</i> 'ref' that holds the reference is itself immutable
	(it can only ever refer to 'a'). However, it holds a <i>reference</i> able to change (mutate) 'a'.
	In this statement, the first permission governs the variable 'ref' and the second governs the reference 
	held by 'ref'. These are two different concerns.</p>
	
	<h3>Lifetime Constraints</h3>
	<p>	Borrowed references are lifetime-constrained, which means that a borrowed reference may never
	outlive the object it refers to. This constraint is enforced by ensuring the lexical scope of the
	borrowed reference is wholly encompassed by the lexical scope of the reference or object it borrowed from.</p>
	<p>For example, a reference may not be borrowed from an object whose lifetime is shorter than the reference:</p>
<pre>
imm a = 3
mut ref = &amp;a
do
  imm b = 4
  ref = &amp;b  // ERROR! b's lexical lifetime is shorter than ref's
</pre>
	<p>When borrowing from a <span class="pre">uni</span> variable or reference,
	the owner becomes inaccessible for the lifetime of borrowed reference.
	In the case of a substructure borrow, it is the collection (not the field or element) that is being borrowed from.</p>
<pre>
uni a = 3
do
  imm ref = &amp;a
  a = 4   // ERROR! a is unavailable due to the borrow
a = 5     // This one is okay, since lifetime of 'ref' has expired
</pre>
	<p>Note that any reference known to have borrowed from a global variable has no lifetime constraint.</p>
	<p>The compiler loses important lifetime information when borrowed references
	are passed to and from another function. In such situations,
	<a href="#lifetime">lifetime annotations</a> may be required to ensure correct
	enforcement of lifetime constraints.</p>
	
	<h2>Dereferencing</h2>
	<p>The <span class="pre">*</span> operator is used to access the contents of a reference.
	Normally, in an expression, it obtains the contents referred to by the reference.
	However, when used to the left of an assignment expression,
	it modifies the referred-to contents:</p>
<pre>
mut a = 3
imm ref = &amp;mut a  // ref holds a mutable reference to a's contents
*ref = 10         // a is now 10.
</pre>
	<p>Such derefencing happens implicitly
	whenever applying a method to (or calling) an object referred to by a reference:</p>
<pre>
mut a = -4
imm ptr = &amp;mut a
imm y = ptr.abs()    // y is 4. Equivalent to: (*ptr).abs
</pre>
	
	<h2>Borrowed References to Functions</h2>
	<p>A reference may borrow from any function.
	Later, that reference may be used to call the function it refers to.</p>
<pre>
fn incr(x i32) i32
  x + 1

fn caller()
  imm fnref = &amp;incr
  fnref(4)            // returns 5 (automatic de-referencing)
</pre>
	<p>Using a similar technique, it is also possible to make use of anonymous functions:</p>
<pre>
fn caller()
  imm fnref = &amp;fn (nbr i32) i32 {nbr+1}
  fnref(4)            // returns 5
</pre>
	<p>Although these are borrowed references, the default lifetime for function references
	is <span class="pre">'static</span>, which means they can be moved around freely
	without any lifetime constraints.</p>
