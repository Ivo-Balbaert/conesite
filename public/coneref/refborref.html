	<p>Borrowed references are different from owning references:
		they neither know nor care which region owns the value they point to.
		As the name suggests, borrowed references are created to point to values that already exist in memory.</p>
	<p>A very common scenario is when we have some existing value and, for some limited lexical scope,
		we want a reference able to work with that value.
		A borrowed reference is ideal for this requirement because:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Borrowed references may point to nearly any value accessible to program logic,	
			including any variable, locked value, field, array element,
			function, method, or any value pointed at by another reference.
			This versatility makes it possible to create generic functions or methods able to
			work with referred-to values no matter which region they were allocated in.</li>
		<li>A borrowed reference is as fast as any reference can be,
			as it never incurs any of the runtime bookkeeping cost borne by some owning references.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Creating a Borrowed Reference</h2>
	<p>Here are several ways to borrow a reference to some existing value.</p>

	<h3>Borrowing from a variable</h3>
	<p>Place the ampersand operator in front of any variable's name
		to create a borrowed reference that points to the value held by that variable.
		This works equally well on any global, local or parameter variable:</p>
<pre>
imm glovar = 2
fn func(parm i32)
	mut localvar = 3
	imm ref1 = &amp;glovar    // ref1's type: &i32
	imm ref2 = &amp;parm      // ref2's type: &i32
	imm ref3 = &amp;localvar  // ref3's type: &i32
</pre>

	<p>Notice how the absence of a region specification alters the ampersand operator's behavior.
		Specifying a region allocates a new value in that region and returns an owning reference.
		Whereas, <i>not</i> specifying a region borrows a reference to some existing value,
		returning a borrowed reference.
		The absence of a specified region emphasizes how much
		a borrowed reference neither knows nor cares
		which region owns the value the references points to.</p>

	<h3>Borrowing from another reference</h3>
	<p>To explicitly create a borrowed reference out of some owning (or borrowed) reference,
		place the ampersand operator in front of a de-referenced reference:</p>
<pre>
imm allocref = &amp;rc 1
imm borref = &*allocref    // Borrow from allocref
</pre>
	<p>In most cases, however, borrowing a reference from an existing reference
		can be handled implicitly, as part of a function (or method) call or assignment.
		This happens when the receiver is given an owning reference but expects a borrowed reference.
		So long as the value type (and permission) match, the borrow is performed automatically.</p>
<pre>
// This function accepts a borrowed reference
fn incr(nbr &amp;i32)
  *nbr + 1

fn main()
  imm allocref = &amp;rc 1   // An owning reference pointing to an allocated value of 1
  incr(allocref)         // Coerces the rc reference to a borrowed reference
</pre>
	<p>Because <i>any</i> reference may be safely coerced to a borrowed reference,
	functions and methods typically accept borrowed references as parameters.
	This capability is what makes possible the benefits mentioned earlier:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Functions and methods can be polymorphic across allocators and permissions at no cost</li>
		<li>Using borrowed references avoids the runtime performance overhead of reference counting (for the rc allocator)
			and reference tracing (for a tracing GC allocator) within these functions.</li>
	</ul>

<h3 id="internal">Referring to a field or array element</h3>

	<p>Unlike an owning reference, a borrowed reference may point to a value within some composite value,
		such as a field in a <a href="refstruct.html">struct</a> 
		or an element in an <a href="refarray.html">array</a>.
		Again, all we need to do is apply the ampersand operator:
	</p>
<pre>
imm ref1 = &amp;apoint.x   // a field within a struct
imm ref2 = &amp;vec[a]     // an element within an array
</pre>
	<p>This kind of internal borrow is quite powerful, as it supports:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Internal reference chains</b>.
		One can reference values within values within values, by chaining together
		fields or indexing:
<pre>
imm ref3 = &amp;vec[3].point.x
</pre>
	<p>Parentheses should be used, where needed, to clearly demark where an internal reference chain ends.
	</p>			
	</li>
	<li><b>Methods in place of fields</b>.
		A method name may be specified (instead of a field name) after the dot operator.
		This calls the method, passing it the reference evaluated so far (as <span class="pre">self</span>),
		and returning a borrowed reference calculated by the method's logic.
		For example:
<pre>
imm ref4 = &amp;pointer.someref(key)  // passes &amp;pointer as self to someref method. Returns a reference
</pre>
	<p>Similarly (for some types), using the indexing operator <span class="pre">[]</span>
		will invoke the type's <span class="pre">[]</span> method to obtained the borrowed reference.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Auto-dereferencing a reference source</b>.
		When an internal reference expression begins with a reference as the source, it is automatically dereferenced:
<pre>
// pointref is a reference to a Point structure
imm ref3 = &amp;pointref.x   // equivalent to:  &amp;*pointref.x
</pre>
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Permissions</h2>
	<p>Like owning references, borrowed references may specify a permission which
		governs what may be done with the reference.
		This permission is specified after the ampersand operator:</p>
<pre>
mut a = 3
imm ref = &amp;mut a   // Creates a mutable borrowed reference to a's value
*ref = 4           // a is now set to 4
</pre>
	<p>The permission requested must be allowed by the source we are borrowing from.
		For example, a mutable borrowed reference may not be obtained from an immutable variable.</p>

	<h3 id="const">const Permission</h3>
	<p>If no permission is specified when creating a borrowed reference
		(as demonstrated in earlier examples),
		the <span class="pre">const</span> permission is assumed.
		A <span class="pre">const</span> reference may read its value, but may not modify that value.
		This description may sound like <span class="pre">imm</span>, but it is not the same.
		<span class="pre">imm</span> guarantees that <i>no</i> other mutable reference to the same object exists,
		making it safe to share between threads. <span class="pre">const</span> makes no such guarantee.
		Therefore, <span class="pre">const</span> references cannot be safely shared with another thread.</p>
		<p>The primary value of <span class="pre">const</span> is how it makes polymorphic
		any functions and methods that promise to not change a referred-to value. 
		By declaring a reference parameter as <span class="pre">const</span>,
		the function or method can safely accept references which the caller sees as
		<span class="pre">mut</span>, <span class="pre">imm</span>, <span class="pre">uni</span>,
		or <span class="pre">const</span>.
		For this reason, <span class="pre">const</span> is the effectively
		the commonly-used, universal receiver for other permissions.
		This is why creating a borrowed reference
		defaults to <span class="pre">const</span> when no permission is specified.</p>			

	<h2>Freezing access to the source of a borrow</h2>
	<p>When a borrowed reference is created, its source is always a named variable.
		That source variable either holds or points to the value we are borrowing a pointer to.
		When we borrow from the source, we are not just gaining access to the value,
		we are also gaining some or all of its access permissions.</p>
	<p>Whenever we borrow from a source with <span class="pre">uni</span> permission,
		which guarantees only one live reference can exist to the value at a time,
		the source variable is made inaccessible for the lifetime of the borrowed reference
		in order to preserve that guarantee:</p>
<pre>
fn freeze(n i32)
  uni uniref = &one 3       // has permission uni
  if n &gt; 1
    imm borref = &*uniref   // borrowing makes uniref inaccessible in this block 
    imm m = *uniref         // oops! uniref is frozen and may not be accessed
  *uniref                   // Safe, because the borrow has expired.
</pre>
	
	<h2>Using a Borrowed Reference</h2>
	<p>Borrowed references may be
			<a href="refallocref.html#ops">dereferenced, compared</a>, and
			<a href="refallocref.html#handle">handled</a>
			in the same way as owning references.
		</p>
	<p>Additionally, one may obtain borrowed references during
		<span class="pre">each</span> iteration or
		pattern matching by using a borrowed reference with the required permission as the source:</p>
<pre>
// increment every number in list
each x in &mut list
  ++*x   // x is a mutable reference
</pre>

	<h3 id="lifetime">Lifetime Constraints</h3>
	<p>The most distinguishing safety constraint on a borrowed reference is that
		its lifetime is constrained to never travel beyond the scope it is created in.
		Carefully managing the lifetime of a borrowed reference is needed for memory safety,
		as it prevents it from pointing to any value with a shorter lifetime.</p>

	<p>This example demonstrates the importance of this restriction:</p>
<pre>
fn getval() i32
  mut ref &amp;i32
  do
    imm a = 5
    ref = &amp;a
  *ref   // Oops!
</pre>
	<p>The scope of the variable <span class="pre">a</span> lasts only for the duration of the do block.
	So when we are done executing that block, the variable <span class="pre">a</span> ceases to exist.
	However, by copying the borrowed reference into <span class="pre">ref</span>, we are effectively
	trying to extend its life beyond the scope it was created in and beyond the life of the value it points to. 
	By attempting to dereference it, we are problematically trying to retrieve a value that is no longer there.</p>
	<p>Most of the time, the compiler has all the information it needs to figure this
		out and generate a error. However, sometimes it needs help in the form of
		<a href="reflifefn.html">lifetime annotations</a>.</p>
