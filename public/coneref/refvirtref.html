	<p>Virtual references are distinct from simple references.
		A virtual reference is used to access some of an object's fields or invoke some of its methods,
		without actually knowing its specific, concrete type.
		This is necessary when runtime conditional logic prevents us from knowing the concrete type at compile-time.
		All a virtual reference knows is that it points to an object whose structure (fields) and behavior (methods)
		conforms to some specified type.</p>

	<h2>A trait example</h2>
	<p>Let's illustrate this with an example:</p>
<pre>
struct Rectangle
  height f32
  width f32
  fn area(self &)
    height * width
  fn perimeter(self &)
    2. * (height + width)

struct Circle
  r f32
  fn area(self &)
    f32::pi * r * r
  fn perimeter(self &)
    2. * f32::pi * r

trait Shape
  fn area(self &)
  fn perimeter(self &)
	
fn doMath(shape &amp;&lt;Shape) f32, f32
  shape.area, shape.perimeter
	
fn tester()
  imm circle = Circle[5]
  doMath(&circle)             // 78.5, 31.4
  imm square = Rectangle[10, 10]
  doMath(&square)             // 100, 40
</pre>
	<p>We define two different types, <span class="pre">Rectangle</span> and <span class="pre">Circle</span>,
		each with different fields. However, both of them implement the
		<span class="pre">area</span> and <span class="pre">perimeter</span> methods.
		We also define a <span class="pre">Shape</span> trait that declares the same two methods.
		Despite the fact that <span class="pre">Rectangle</span> and <span class="pre">Circle</span>
		never say that they comply with (nor inherit from) the <span class="pre">Shape</span> trait, the fact
		that both types implement all its methods means they are compliant with this trait.</p>
	<p>The <span class="pre">doMath</span> function accepts a virtual reference
		(denoted by <span class="pre">&amp;&lt;</span>)
		to some object whose type is compliant with the <span class="pre">Shape</span> trait.
		Using this reference, it returns two numbers calculated by applying
		the <span class="pre">area</span> and <span class="pre">perimeter</span>
		methods on the object. If the object happens to be a <span class="pre">Rectangle</span>,
		it will use the methods defined for <span class="pre">Rectangle</span>.
		Likewise, it will use the <span class="pre">Circle</span> methods,
		if that is actual type of the object.</p>
	<p>The <span class="pre">tester</span> function demonstrates this behavior
		by creating a specific circle and rectangle, borrowing a reference to each,
		and then calling <span class="pre">doMath</span> on them both.
		The calculated results we get back reflect that the right method was used,
		based on the actual type of the object.</p>

	<h2>How the Magic Works</h2>
	<p>Even though <span class="pre">doMath</span> <i>seems</i> to have no idea what
		the concrete type is of <span class="pre">shape</span>, it nonetheless
		correctly invokes the appropriate concrete type method. It can do this because
		virtual references are "fat" references containing two pieces of information: 
		a reference to the real object itself and a reference to a <i>vtable</i>. 
		This vtable makes the magic possible
		by describing key information about the object's concrete type
		as viewed from the perspective of the trait.
		In particular, it captures reference addresses for the type's trait-declared methods
		and location information for trait-declared fields,
		as well as unique id identifying the concrete type.</p>
	<p>In this example, the vtable contains two references to the concrete type's
		<span class="pre">area</span> and <span class="pre">perimeter</span> methods.
		There are actually two different versions of this vtable,
		one for references to <span class="pre">Circle</span> objects
		and a different one for references to <span class="pre">Rectangle</span> objects.
		When a borrowed reference to one of those two types of objects is
		passed to <span class="pre">doMath</span>, a virtual reference is automatically
		created by attaching the type-specific vtable to the known pointer to the object.</p>
	<p>When <span class="pre">doMath</span> invokes a method using a virtual reference,
		it retrieves a reference to that method out of the virtual reference's vtable.
		Then it calls that method passing the appropriate information,
		in this case the reference to the object.
		Calling a method indirectly (via a vtable) is called dynamic (or virtual) dispatch.</p>
	
	<h3>Working with Virtual References</h3>
	<p>As the example above shows, a virtual reference is automatically created (coerced)
		when passing a regular reference to a variable or function expecting a virtual reference.
		This is called <i>upcasting</i>.</p>
	<p>A compiler error will result if the concrete type 
		does not structurally conform to the virtual reference's expected type.
		The virtual reference's expected type can be a struct, trait, enum or enumtrait.
		Compliance simply means that all the fields and methods defined on the reference's type
		have been implemented by the concrete type.
		The compliant type may implement more fields and methods,
		but it must implement at least the ones the reference's type defines.</p>
	<p>This coercion may be explicitly requested using the <span class="pre">as</span> operator:</p>
<pre>
mut virtref = &circle as &amp;&lt;Shape
</pre>
	<p>Virtual references can be owning or borrowed. 
		They can be freely passed around, stored, or compared much like all other references.
		However, virtual references may not be de-referenced using the 
		<span class="pre">*</span> operator, as a virtual reference can point to objects
		of very different size and data composition.</p>
	<p>The primary use of virtual references lies with the dot operator.
		This is how one dispatches trait-declared methods and accesses trait-declared fields.</p>
	
	<h2>Pattern matching</h2>
	<p>Sometimes we want to re-obtain the specific, concrete-type reference to an object
		we have a virtual reference for. This is called downcasting.
		This can be accomplished using pattern matching:</p>
<pre>
match shape
  ~~Circle:
    // 'shape' is now usable as having type &Circle
  ~~Rectangle:
    // 'shape' is now usable as having type &Rectangle
  _:
    // some other unknown shape type
</pre>
	<p>Since a virtual reference might have been created from objects of many different types,
		we use pattern matching to figure out which concrete type originally created the object,
		information held by the vtable.</p>

	<h2>Type Restrictions</h2>
	<p>Some types may not be suitable
		when used as a foundation for virtual references.
		This would be the case if any method were defined as a generic function.
		It would also happen if the type makes any use of <span class="pre">Self</span>
		in any form other than as a virtual reference 
		(<span class="pre">&amp;&lt;Self</span>).</p>

	<h2 id="cloref">Closure References</h2>
	<p>Earlier, we introduced value-based <a href="refclosure.html">closures</a>.
		Value-based closures struggle when we need closures that have a specific calling signature,
		but whose underlying struct state may vary in size and fields.
		To satisfy this requirement, a closure may be passed as a virtual reference.</p>
	<p>Let's illustrate this with a simple event-handling example:</p>
<pre>
window.whenClicked(&amp;so |{window}| { ... })
</pre>
	<p>Here we allocate a new click-handling closure using the single-owner region
		(ensuring it is automatically freed after being triggered and discarded).
		The closure's state remembers the window, which its logic uses when
		the window is clicked.</p>
	<p>The <span class="pre">whenClicked</span> method accepts any closure
		whose type signature is <span class="pre">&amp;&lt;so ||</span>.
		In other words, it accepts closures having any underlying state,
		so long as the closure's function signature matches
		(it accepts no arguments and returns no values).</p>
	<p>Closures allocated this way are virtual references.
		In the same way that closures are implicit structs,
		closure references take advantage of an implicit trait,
		one which defines the appropriate method signature 
		for the <span class="pre">()</span> method.</p>
	<p>When the event fires on a click,
		the event handler simply calls the closure to perform its defined logic:</p>
<pre>
handler()
</pre>
