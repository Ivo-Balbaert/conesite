	<p>Virtual references are another kind of reference, distinct from simple and array references.
		A virtual reference is used to access some of an object's fields or invoke some of its methods,
		without actually knowing its specific, concrete type.
		This is necessary when we can't know the concrete type at compile-time, 
		as the decision of the value's type is made at run-time.
		All the reference knows is that it points to an object whose structure and behavior
		conforms to some specified trait.</p>

	<h2>A trait example</h2>
	<p>Let's illustrate this with an example:</p>
<pre>
struct Rectangle
  height f32
  width f32
  fn area(self &)
    height * width
  fn perimeter(self &)
    2. * (height + width)

struct Circle
  r f32
  fn area(self &)
    f32::pi * r * r
  fn perimeter(self &)
    2. * f32::pi * r

trait Shape
  fn area(self &)
  fn perimeter(self &)
	
fn doMath(shape &amp;&lt;Shape) f32, f32
  shape.area, shape.perimeter
	
fn tester()
  imm circle = Circle[5]
  doMath(&circle)             // 78.5, 31.4
  imm square = Rectangle[10, 10]
  doMath(&square)             // 100, 40
</pre>
	<p>We define two different types, <span class="pre">Rectangle</span> and <span class="pre">Circle</span>,
		each with different fields. However, both of them implement the
		<span class="pre">area</span> and <span class="pre">perimeter</span> methods.
		We also define a <span class="pre">Shape</span> trait that declares the same two methods.
		Despite the fact that <span class="pre">Rectangle</span> and <span class="pre">Circle</span>
		never say that they comply with the <span class="pre">Shape</span> trait, the fact
		that both types implement all its methods means they are compliant with this trait.</p>
	<p>The <span class="pre">doMath</span> function accepts a virtual reference
		(denoted by <span class="pre">&amp;&lt;</span>)
		to some object whose type is compliant with the <span class="pre">Shape</span> trait.
		Using this reference, it returns two numbers calculated by applying
		the <span class="pre">area</span> and <span class="pre">perimeter</span>
		methods on the object. If the object happens to be a <span class="pre">Rectangle</span>,
		it will use the methods defined for <span class="pre">Rectangle</span>.
		Likewise, it will use the <span class="pre">Circle</span> methods,
		if that is actual type of the object.</p>
	<p>The <span class="pre">tester</span> function demonstrates this behavior
		by creating a specific circle and rectangle, borrowing a reference to each,
		and then calling <span class="pre">doMath</span> on them both.
		The calculated results we get back reflect that the right method was used,
		based on the actual type of the object.</p>

	<h2>How the Magic Works</h2>
	<p>Even though <span class="pre">doMath</span> <i>seems</i> to have no idea what
		the concrete type is of <span class="pre">shape</span>, it nonetheless
		correctly invokes the appropriate concrete type method. It can do this because
		virtual references are "fat" references containing two pieces of information: 
		a reference to the real object itself and a reference to a <i>vtable</i>. 
		This vtable makes the magic possible
		by describing key information about the object's concrete type
		as viewed from the perspective of the trait.
		In particular, it captures reference addresses for the type's trait-declared methods
		and location information for trait-declared fields,
		as well as unique id identifying the concrete type.</p>
	<p>In this example, the vtable contains two references to the concrete type's
		<span class="pre">area</span> and <span class="pre">perimeter</span> methods.
		There are actually two different versions of this vtable,
		one for references to <span class="pre">Circle</span> objects
		and a different one for references to <span class="pre">Rectangle</span> objects.
		When a borrowed reference to one of those two types of objects is
		passed to <span class="pre">doMath</span>, a virtual reference is automatically
		created by attaching the type-specific vtable to the known pointer to the object.</p>
	<p>When <span class="pre">doMath</span> invokes a method using a virtual reference,
		it retrieves a reference to that method out of the virtual reference's vtable.
		Then it calls that method passing the appropriate information,
		in this case the reference to the object.
		Calling a method indirectly (via a vtable) is called dynamic (or virtual) dispatch.</p>
	
	<h3>Working with Virtual References</h3>
	<p>As the example above shows, a virtual reference is automatically created (coerced)
		when passing a regular reference to a variable or function expecting a virtual reference.
		This is called <i>upcasting</i>.
		A compiler error will be triggered if the type does not conform to the expected trait.
		This coercion may be explicitly requested using the <span class="pre">as</span> operator:</p>
<pre>
mut virtref = &circle as &amp;&lt;Shape
</pre>
	<p>Virtual references can be owning or borrowed. 
		They can be freely passed around, stored, or compared much like all other references.
		However, virtual references may not be de-referenced using the 
		<span class="pre">*</span> operator, as a virtual reference can point to objects
		of very different size and data composition.</p>
	<p>The primary use of virtual references lies with the dot operator.
		This is how one dispatches trait-declared methods and accesses trait-declared fields.</p>
	
	<h2>Pattern matching</h2>
	<p>Sometimes we want to re-obtain the specific, concrete-type reference to an object
		we have a virtual reference for. This is called downcasting.
		This can be accomplished using pattern matching:</p>
<pre>
match shape
  ~~Circle:
    // 'shape' is now usable as having type &Circle
  ~~Rectangle:
    // 'shape' is now usable as having type &Rectangle
  _:
    // some other unknown shape type
</pre>
	<p>Since a virtual reference might have been created from objects of many different types,
		we need pattern matching to figure out which concrete type originally created the object.</p>

	<h2>enum-based Virtual References</h2>
	<p>Besides traits, virtual references can be also be created from enum- or union-typed values.
		Think of the enum type as if it were acting in the role of a trait.
		In order for the virtual reference to dispatch to methods,
		outer enum type needs to define signatures for all the methods 
		it expects to find in common across all the variant types it enumerates.
		Obviously, every variant type also needs to have implementations for all those methods.</p>
	<p>Instead of using a trait, we could define our example above with Shape as an enum:</p>
<pre>
enum Shape
  fn area(self &)
  fn perimeter(self &)
	
  Circle
  Rectangle
</pre>		
	
	<p>A virtual reference built on an enum works the same way as one built using traits. 
		This approach can be valuable when you already want to use sum types for other
		reasons (fixed-sized, value-based data), but also want to
		leverage dynamic dispatch where that sort of runtime, method-based
		dispatch flexibility is required.</p>
