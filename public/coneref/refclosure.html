	<p>A closure is a function that preserves its state from one invocation to the next.
		The closure's logic accesses its state using bound closure variables.</p>
	<p>Because closures preserve their state, they are useful for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Iterators, which retrieve a sequence of values one-at-a-time from a defined collection.</li>
		<li>Generators that return a different value on each use</li>
		<li>Event-triggered callbacks, whose state guides what happens after an event is triggered.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Simple Closure</h2>
	<p>A closure definition looks similar to a function definition, but uses vertical bars to enclose parameters.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
imm cnt = 5
mut counter = || cnt++   // closure definition
counter()                // 5
counter()                // 6
</pre>
  <p>In this case, the closure takes no parameters. It infers that the return value is an integer.
		Importantly, the closure's state is established by the variable it binds from the outer scope,
		in this case the local variable <span class="pre">cnt</span>.
		Each time the closure is called, it increments the value held by <span class="pre">cnt</span>.
		which is why it returns a different value each time it is called.</p>
	<p>A closure's state is bound by value, which means it is created using a <i>copy</i> of the bound variable(s).
		Any change to <span class="pre">cnt</span> within the closure has
		no impact on the outer scope's <span class="pre">cnt</span> variable.
		(Binding state by reference is also possible. We will talk about this after
		introducing reference types.)</p>
	
	<h2>Explicit State Definition</h2>
  <p>Often it is clearer and more convenient to define a closure's state explicitly.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
mut counter = |n i32 {cnt = 0}| cnt += n
counter(1)        // 1
counter(2)        // 3
</pre>
  <p>This closure's state is defined explicitly within curly braces at the end of the parameter list.
			Each closure variable should specify an initial value.
			Multiple closure variables are delimited by semi-colons.
			Think of the state definition as defining an anonymous struct. Here it defines one field called
		<span class="pre">cnt</span> whose initial value is 0.
	</p>
	<p>It is often better to define an explicit state.
		It signals to the code reader which variables represent the closure's state.
		It simplifies the code (like here) when the closure variable is not a mirror of an existing
		variable in an outer scope, but can be initialized with some expression or literal.
		It is also useful when we want to bind by reference.</p>
	
	<h2>Closures are anonymous structs</h2>
	<p>A closure is really just syntactic sugar for an anonymous struct.
		The following code is equivalent to the above example:
	</p>
<pre>
struct _cntstr
  _cnt = 0
  fn `()`(n i32)
    _cnt += n

mut counter = _cntstr[]
counter(1)        // 1
counter(2)        // 3
</pre>
	<p>As this example demonstrates, the closure itself is defined by the
		<span class="pre">_cntstr</span> struct.
		The closure's state is define by its field(s).
		The functional logic is captured within a single method named
		<span class="pre">()</span>.</p>
	<p>As we learned on the previous page, an object may be "called" just like a function.
		Doing so invokes the <span class="pre">()</span> method.
		In this way any explicitly callable struct is effectively also a closure.</p>
	<p>This is not all there is to say about closures.
		We'll come back later to talk about the more powerful
		<a href="refclosref.html">closure references</a> later,
		when we cover references and interfaces.</p>
