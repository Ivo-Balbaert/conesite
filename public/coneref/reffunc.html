	<p>The previous page showed how to call functions as part of an expression.
	Now it is time to show how to declare and implement functions.
	In fact, all logic (including expressions) must be defined as part of the implementation
	of a function (or method).</p>
	<p>Let's start with a simple example of a function definition and its use:</p>
<pre>
// Define the 'square' function
fn square(a f32) f32
	return a*a

// Use square to calculate the area of a circle	
area = Float.pi * square(r)
</pre>
	
	<p>This example shows the key parts of an function definition:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The <b>signature</b> which declares its:
	<ul>
	<li><b>name</b> (square in this example).</li>
	<li><b>parameters</b> in parentheses (a in this example).</li>
	<li><b>return type(s)</b> which follows the parentheses (f32 in this example).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The function's <a href="#stmtblk">implementation block</a> follows the signature.
	The block contains indented statement(s) that represent the logic to be performed by the function.</li>
	</ul>
	 
	<h3 id="parms">Parameter Variables</h3>
	<p>The declaration of a functions's parameters is a comma-separated list of variable names, 
	enclosed in parentheses.
	Each parameter variable corresponds on a one-to-one basis to the value arguments passed to the function when it is called.
	They must match in both number and type:</p>
<pre>
// Define a method that returns the addition of its two parameters
fn add(a i32, b i32) i32
	return a+b

add(2,3)  // returns 5, since a is set to 2 and b to 3
add(2)    // ERROR! add() needs exactly two values, not one or three
add(2.0, 4.0)  // ERROR! add() needs integers, not floating point numbers
</pre>

	<p>Parameters are variables, usable within the function.
	The function's signature effectively declares the parameter variables in the same format as any variable declaration.
	In the example above, the permission is not specified and therefore
	<span class="pre">imm</span> is assumed.
	That restricts the function's logic from changing the value of these passed parameters.</p>
	<p>To allow a parameter's value to be changed, precede the name with <span class="pre">mut</span>.
	Mutation of the parameter's value has
	no effect on the caller since the parameter's value is a copy of the caller's value.
	Changes to one value do not affect the other.</p>
<pre>
fn weird(a i32, mut b i32)
	a = 34    // ERROR! a is immutable and may not be changed
	b = 4     // b may be changed since it is declared 'mut'

number = 3
weird(5, number)
// number is still 3, despite weird() changing b to 4
</pre>

	<h4>Parameter Defaults</h4>
	<p>If desired, default values may be specified for any parameter value using the assignment operator '='.
	The default value is what we want the parameter to have if the caller provides no value for it.
	The default value can only be a literal value.</p>
<pre>
fn next(nbr i32, incr i32 = 1) i32
	return nbr + incr

next(5,2) // returns 7
next(4)   // returns 5 (using incr's default value of 1)
next()    // ERROR! no default value for nbr
</pre>

	<h2 id="stmtblk">Implementation Block</h2>
	<p>The function's implementation block is represented by a sequence of indented statements
		that perform the function's logic.
		Generally, each statement is performed in order.</p>
	<p>Most statements are just expressions.
	A statement could also be a local variable declaration,
	some nested <a href="refblock.html">block</a>, or one of a set of special statements
	(e.g., 'return').</p>

	<h3 id="local">Local Variable Declarations</h3>
	<p>Any variable declared wihin a function (including its parameters) has a 
		scope that is <i><a href="refterm.html#scope">local</a></i> to that function.
		It cannot be referenced or used outside of that scope.</p>
<p>Local variables provide a working state for the function.
		Every time a function is called, space is allocated on the execution stack
		for all its declared local variables.
		When the function is finished and returns to its caller, 
		its local variable space is automatically freed from the stack.</p>
<pre>
fn summult(a f32, b f32) f32
	imm sum = a + b    // local variable declaration
	imm mult = a * b   // local variable declaration
	return sum / mult
</pre>
	<p>This means that local variables are exclusive to that call.
		Two identically-named local variables in different functions,
		or even two calls to the same function, will not collide with each other.</p>

	<h3 id="return">Return Statement</h3>
	<p>A <span class="pre">return</span> statement may be placed at the end of any block.
	When encountered, execution of the function ceases and
	the comma-separated values specified after <span class="pre">return</span> are returned to the caller.
	The number and types of all return values must match the return types declared on the function's signature.</p>
<pre>
fn ceil(x i32) i32, i32
	if x > 6
		return x, 6
	return x, x

mut a,b = ceil(8)   // returns 8,6
a,b = ceil(3)       // returns 3,3
</pre>

	<h4>Implicit returns</h4>
	<p>A function does not have to specify a <span class="pre">return</span> statement at the end of its main block.
	If the function signature does not declare a return value, the function just 
	returns after the last statement is performed.</p>
	<p>If the function signature declares that values must be returned, 
	an attempt is made to matching the values on the last statement or block of the function:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>if it is an expression whose types match, it is treated as if <span class="pre">return</span> 
	were specified before the expression:
<pre>
fn ceil(x i32) i32, i32
	if x > 6
		return x, 6
	x, x   // implicit return
</pre></li>
	<li>An <a href="refcontrol.html#if"><span class="pre">if</span></a> or 
	<a href="refcontrol.html#match"><span class="pre">match</span></a>
	returns the last statement's expression in each of its distinct blocks (this is handled recursively). 
	All paths (including a required <span class="pre">else</span> block) must return valid values.</li>
<pre>
fn ceil(x i32) i32, i32
	if x > 6
		x, 6   // implicit return
	else
		x, x   // implicit return
</pre></li>
	<li>A final <a href="refthis.html"><span class="pre">this</span></a> block returns the value of 
	<span class="pre">this</span>.</li>
<pre>
fn newthing() Thing
	+Thing    // implicitly returns this newly created thing
		name:  "Doofus"
		color: "brown"
</pre>
	</ul>
	<p>Should the correct number of type-matching return values not be found as described above,
	a compile error will result.</p>

	<h3 id="recursive">Recursive Functions</h3>
	<p>A function may call itself recursively:</p>
<pre>
fn factorial(x i32, prod i32 = 1)
	return prod if x&lt;=1
	factorial(x-1, prod*x)
</pre>
	<p>If the function returns a single value calculated by any function, 
		this <i>may</i> be "tail-call" optimized.
	This optimization improves performance and 
	reduces the risk of execution stack overrun with recursive calls.</p>

	<h2 id="pure">Pure functions</h2>
	<p>Sometimes it is valuable when a function guarantees that its <i>only</i> work
		involves calculating return value(s) derived wholly 
		from the information passed as parameters.
		Such functions are called pure. Pure functions may not:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Access global, mutable variables</b>, except to use regions to allocate memory.</li>
			<li><b>Call functions or methods that are not pure.</b>
				This effectively prevents the function from doing any I/O,
				since that requires use of functions that won't be marked as pure.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Functions complying with these constraints
		should be marked as <span class="pre">pure</span>.</p>
<pre>
pure fn factorial(n i32) i32
  return 1 if x&lt;=1
  mut result = 1
  result *= n while n-- > 1
  result
</pre>
	<p>A key benefit for marking functions <span class="pre">pure</span>:
		it makes code easier to understand, debug and test.
		When examining logic that uses a pure function,
		we can be confident that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Passing it the same data will always return the same results.</li>
		<li>Using it will not trigger some unexpected state-changing behavior (side-effect),
			such as performing any sort of i/o.</li>
		<li>It will not mutate any state other than objects it has explicitly been 
			given mutable references to.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Pure functions are also beneficial due to the safety guarantees they offer when:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="refmodule.html#dyninit">dynamically initializing global variables</a> at runtime.</li>
		<li>using them to calculate constant values at compile-time</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Strong purity</h3>
	<p>The compiler only enforces the purity constraints listed above, 
		resulting in what some may consider a weak form of purity.
		A stronger form of purity (referential transparency) may be obtained by ensuring:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>none of the parameters are mutable references or pointers.</li>
		<li>the logic never uses potentially non-deterministic operations, 
			such as comparing pointers or
			re-casting machine-specific value encodings to other types.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Only a strongly pure functions can be safely memo-ized.</p>
