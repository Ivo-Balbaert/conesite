	<p>When building programs, it can be very useful to make use of reusable code libraries
		written by others. Such libraries are distributed as <b>packages</b>.</p>

	<h2>import</h2>
	<p>To make use of a package in your program, employ the 
		<span class="pre">import</span> command in the global area:</p>
<pre>
import math3d
import opengl
</pre>

	<p>This example imports two packages. 
		Cone's build tool (Congo) will automatically find, download, and prepare
		these packages for inclusion in your program.
		Thereafter, you can make use of the types, functions, templates, macros
		that are defined by these packages as if they were now a part of your program.
	</p>
	<p>A package name may be enclosed in double quotes, if desired.
		This option is useful when a package's name includes symbols not allowed in a variable name.
		It may also be used whenever one wants to refer to a package
		using the folder or URL path where the package may be found.
	</p>
	
	<p><b>Note:</b> It is never necessary to import the standard library (std). 
	It is automatically included as part of every program.</p>
	
	<h2 id="pathname">Namespace Path</h2>
	<p>To reference entities defined by the package, a namespace path may be used
		(since an imported package is treated as a module namespace).
		So we can reference the Point3 type in the math3d package,
		by qualifying (with a double colon) the type's name with the package's namespace:
	</p>
<pre>
fn move(pos &amp;math3d::Point3, delta math3d::Point3)
		pos += delta
</pre>
	<p>Typically, path names are relative to the current module.
		This behavior can be overridden by using one of two special prefixes:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><span class="pre">::</span> begins with the main (root) namespace.</li>
	<li><span class="pre">super::</span> begins with the parent module that owns the current module.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Namespace folding</h3>
	<p>The default practice of wrapping the named items of an external packages in its own namespace is hygienic.
     It prevents polluting the program's namespace with unanticipated names that might collide.</p>
	<p>However, frequent use of fully-qualified path names for external package entities
		can get tedious to type and read.
		The <span class="pre">import</span> command provides several ways to fold the package's
		namespace into the current namespace, thereby avoiding the need to qualify a name with a path prefix.</p>
	<p>To fold in specific names from the package's namespace:</p>
<pre>
import math3d Point3, Mat3

fn move(pos &amp;Point3, delta Point3)
		pos += delta
</pre>
  <p>To fold in an alias for specific names:</p>
<pre>
import math3d Point3 as Point

fn move(pos &amp;Point, delta Point)
		pos += delta
</pre>
	<p>Or one can fold in all names from the package using '*':</p>
<pre>
import math3d *

fn move(pos &amp;Point3, delta Point3)
		pos += delta
</pre>
