	<h3>own - Single owner (RAII with escape analysis)</h3>
	<p>Only one allocated reference may point to any own-allocated value.
	  That reference may be passed around from function to function or from thread to thread.
	  The memory for that value is automatically dropped and freed when its single reference goes out of its last scope.
	  'own' is similar to Rust's Box&lt;T&gt; single-owner mechanism.</p>
	<p>The key benefits are performance, deterministic drops, and memory efficiency.
	  The performance benefit comes from avoiding the need for runtime bookkeeping,
	  since the allocated value's lifetime can be determined at compile time.
	  The biggest downside is its data structure inflexibility.
	  It cannot safely handle data structures that require multiple allocated references to the same value,
	  such as all cyclic and many directed acyclic graphs.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> An 'own' allocated reference only accepts the 'uni' or 'imm' permissions.
	It is not possible to alias an own allocated reference.
	Any attempt to do so simply <a href="refmove.html">moves</a> the reference to a new binding.</p>
