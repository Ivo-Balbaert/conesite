	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: None of this capability is currently implemented.</i></p>

	<p>As with <span class="pre">if</span>, pattern matching is about deciding
	which code path to perform. 
	Its approach is to match a single value in order against multiple patterns.
	The code block associated with the first matching pattern is performed.</p>
	<p>Let's illustrate this with a simple (but mathematically unusual) example:</p>
<pre>
fn power(n i32, pow i32) i32
  match pow
    0: 1
    1: n
    2: n * n
    _: -1
</pre>
	<p>This example returns a value calculated differently based on the value of pow.
	If pow is zero, we return 1. If pow is 1, we return n.
	If pow is two, we return n squared. 
	Finally, if pow is any other value, we return -1.</p>
	<p>The structure of this form of pattern matching is straightforward:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Any normal expression can be used after <span class="pre">match</span>.
	This expression's evaluated value is what patterns are matched with.
	If desired, an assignment expression can be used here to capture
	this matchee value for later use in matched code blocks.</li>
	<li>Any number of pattern blocks may follow. Each is comprised of a pattern
	followed by either a block or else a colon and a expression.
	If any pattern matches, the evaluated value of its block or expression is the match's value</li>
	<li>Using the <span class="pre">_</span> pattern will always match any value.
	If specified, it should be the last pattern used.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A versatile range of patterns are supported, 
	able to match wholly to specified values, partially, or using a first-class pattern.
	Pattern matching also supports de-structuring portions of the original value
	into bound variables.</p>

	<h2>Whole Value Matches</h2>
	<p>These patterns involve straightforward comparisons between the matchee value
	and one or more pattern values.</p>
	<h3>Equivalence</h3>
	<p>The simplest form of matching uses a value as the pattern.
	This can be a constant value (as above) or any expression that evaluates to some value,
	for example:</p>
<pre>
match val
  anotherval.len:  4
  _:               0
</pre>
	<p>The type of the pattern value must match the type of the matchee value.
	An equivalence match is performed between these values as if using the '==' operator.</p>
	
	<h3>Comparisons</h3>
	<p>Comparison patterns make use of the <a href="refif.html#compop">comparison operators</a>
	(including <span class="pre">!=</span>).
	The left hand value is not specified, as it is understood to be the match value:</p>
<pre>
match n
  <0: -1
  >0:  1
  _:   0
</pre>

	<h3>Range pattern</h3>
	<p>The range pattern checks whether the matchee value lies within a specified
	range. This is specified by placing either the
	<span class="pre">..</span> or <span class="pre">...</span> range operator
	between two expressions:</p>
<pre>
match n
  0 ..  3: 1   // matches 0, 1, or 2 (but not 3)
  3 ... 6: 2   // matches 3, 4, 5 or 6 inclusively
</pre>
	
	<h2>Pattern Expressions</h2>
	<p>Before continuing on to talk about partial pattern matching,
	let's introduce ways to enhance the match patterns already described
	as part of a more comprehensive pattern expression.</p>

	<h3>Multiple patterns</h3>
	<p>It is possible to list more than one possible pattern to match,
	using <span class="pre">or</span> between each pattern:</p>
<pre>
match n
  2 or 3 or 5 or 7:  2
  -6 or -1...1 or 6: 1
  _:                 0
</pre>
	
	<h3>Tuples</h3>
	<p>Multiple values to be matched can be specified on the
	<span class="pre">match</span> statement as a comma-separated tuple
	or with a function that returns multiple values.
	If a tuple is specified on the match, then all match patterns must be specified as tuples.
	For a tuple to match, all values must match individually:</p>
<pre>
match key,value
  0, _:  0
  _, 0:  1
  _, _:  2
</pre>

	<h3>if Guards</h3>
	<p>An 'if' clause may be specified following all patterns as an additional guard.
	The condition expression after the 'if' must evaluate to true in order for the
	match to take place.</p>
<pre>
match nbr
  4 if cnt &gt; 0: 0  // matches only if nbr==4 and cnt&gt;0
  4:            1  // matches when nbr==4 and cnt&lt;=0
  _:            2  // matches when nbr != 4
</pre>

	
	<h2>Partial matches</h2>
	<p>When dealing with a composite data structure, partial matching
	supports value or type matching on selected parts of that data.
	A partial match pattern mimics the type structure of the data we are matching
	against, specifying match patterns for the value or type of 
	particular substructural elements.
	It also supports "destructuring", binding variables to these or other substructural elements.</p>
	<p>Partial match patterns begin with the <span class="pre">~~</span> operator. 
		Additional specifics of the pattern vary by type.</p>

	<h3 id="array">Array partial matches</h3>
	<p>The simplest partial match checks whether an array (or array reference) begins with
		certain elements:</p>
<pre>
match name
	~~ "Judy": judy     // Matches if name string begins with "Judy"
	~~ "Frank": frank
	_: noone
</pre>
	<p>Alternatively, one can specify matching patterns for the first few elements:</p>
<pre>
match numbers
	~~ [1, _]: 1
	~~ [_, 1]: 2
	~~ [&lt;=0, &lt;=0]: 3
	_: 4
</pre>

	<h3 id="struct">Struct partial matches</h3>
	<p>A matching pattern may be created for specific named fields:</p>
<pre>
match points
  ~~ Point[0., _]: 1
  ~~ Point[_, 0.]: 2
  ~~ Point[&lt;0., &lt=0.]: 3
  _: 4
</pre>
	<p>Any unspecified fields in a struct pattern are assumed to match.</p>

	<h3 id="enum">Enum partial matches</h3>
	<p>An enum pattern typically just matches against each option's variant type,
		binding to a variable:</p>
<pre>
match oddval
	~~ intval = SomeInt:     intval
	~~ point = PointStruct:  i32[point.x * point.y]
	None:                    0
</pre>
	<p>If desired, pattern matching and binding can also be applied to the internal value(s):</p>
<pre>
match oddval
  ~~ intval = SomeInt[&lt;0]:   -intval
  ~~ intval = SomeInt:       intval
  ~~ PointStruct[x=_, y=_]:  i32[x * y]
  None:                      0
</pre>

	<h2>First-class patterns</h2>
	<p>Whole and partial matching patterns handle many situations, but not all.
	First-class patterns make it possible to support more sophisticated matching
	algorithms.
	Such algorithms are implemented in a callable function or method
	that returns true for a successful match.
	<p>Use of a first-class pattern is signaled using the <span class="pre">with</span> keyword.
	The matchee value is implicitly included as part of the call
	(essentially, the first parameter for a function and the second for a method call):</p>
<pre>
match n
  with isPrime(): 0  // invokes isPrime(n)
  with isOdd():   1  // invokes isOdd(n)
  _:              2
</pre>
	<p>This technique can be quite powerful, 
	as it makes it possible to support a broad range of complex
	pattern matching strategies, such as regular expressions, parsing, etc.
	A first-class pattern can be an object with state that changes as a result of
	a successful match. As part of the match, data can be extracted from the
	matchee value and preserved for later use by the match block.</p>
	
	<p><b>Note:</b> A first class pattern can also be applied to any arbitrary value as part of
	an <span class="pre">if</span> statement:</p>
<pre>
++nbr if isOdd(n)
</pre>
