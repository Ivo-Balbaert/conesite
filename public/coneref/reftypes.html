	<p>A type is a pattern that:
	<ul>
	<li>Declares the possible values for data and describes how it is encoded</li>
	<li>Specifies the operations that can be performed using that data</li>
	<li>Establishes constraints enforced by the compiler or run-time mechanisms</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Explicit declaration of types are valuable for optimizing a program's performance and space efficiency,
	as well as offer compile-time safety protections.</p>
	<p>This page briefly introduces the various kinds of types and describes
	features that they share in common.</p>
	
	<h2>Kinds of Types</h2>
	
	<p>Most types are value types; they apply to any value used and manipulated by a program:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Primitive numbers, such as the unsigned integers (u32), signed integers (i32), floats (f32)
	and Bool (effectively a 1-bit unsigned integer, whose values are called true and false).</li>
	<li><a href="refstruct.html">structs</a>, 
	interfaces, traits, and tuples which establish a record-like collection of fields.</li>
	<li>arrays, vectors and dictionaries, which establish an indexed collection of same-typed elements.</li>
	<li>sum types, which can hold values from two or more different types.</li>
	<li>references and pointers, whose value is a pointer that refers to a value of another type
	somewhere else in memory.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Reference management types mediate the use of references to ensure memory and race safety:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="refperm.html">Permissions</a>, 
	which establish the usage capabilities and restrictions that apply to variables and references.</li>
	<li><a href="refallocref.html">Allocators</a>, 
	which manage memory safely and efficiently on behalf of programs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Execution types apply to various units of execution.
	Instead of defining their data content, they declare how they are to be used:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Functions, methods and closures, which hold code that can be applied to values.</li>
	<li>Threads, co-routines and actors, which represent distinct execution states for running code.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These type kinds are used like type factories, enabling definition of specific types,
	as detailed by the respective chapters that cover each kind of type.</p>
