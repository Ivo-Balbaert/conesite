	<p>A type is a pattern that:
	<ul>
	<li>Declares the possible values for data and describes how it is encoded</li>
	<li>Specifies the operations that can be performed using that data</li>
	<li>Establishes constraints enforced by the compiler or run-time mechanisms</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Explicit declaration of types are valuable for optimizing a program's performance and space efficiency,
	as well as offer compile-time safety protections.</p>
	<p>This page briefly introduces the various kinds of types and describes
	features that they share in common.</p>
	
	<h2>Kinds of Types</h2>
	
	<p>Most types are value types; they apply to any value used and manipulated by a program:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Primitive numbers, such as the unsigned integers (u32), signed integers (i32), floats (f32)
	and Bool (effectively a 1-bit unsigned integer, whose values are called true and false).</li>
	<li><a href="refstruct.html">structs</a>, 
	interfaces, traits, and tuples which establish a record-like collection of fields.</li>
	<li>arrays, vectors and dictionaries, which establish an indexed collection of same-typed elements.</li>
	<li>sum types, which can hold values from two or more different types.</li>
	<li>references and pointers, whose value is a pointer that refers to a value of another type
	somewhere else in memory.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Reference management types mediate the use of references to ensure memory and race safety:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="refperm.html">Permissions</a>, 
	which establish the usage capabilities and restrictions that apply to variables and references.</li>
	<li><a href="refallocref.html">Allocators</a>, 
	which manage memory safely and efficiently on behalf of programs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Execution types apply to various units of execution.
	Instead of defining their data content, they declare how they are to be used:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Functions, methods and closures, which hold code that can be applied to values.</li>
	<li>Threads, co-routines and actors, which represent distinct execution states for running code.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These type kinds are used like type factories, enabling definition of specific types,
	as detailed by the respective chapters that cover each kind of type.</p>
	
	<h2>Strict Typing, Coercion and Conversion</h2>
	<p>Typing is strict. In most cases, attempting to place a value of one type into a container
	declared as another type will generate a compile-time error.
	However, there are times when this is allowed:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Subtype Coercion</b>.
	If type A is a valid subtype (perfect subset) of some type B.
	one may pass a value of type B to a function expecting a value of type A.
	This coercion capability is particularly valuable when using an interface or trait 
	as a viewing window into a number of different, but compatible structs.
	This principle also applies when coercing reference permissions 
	(e.g., <span class="pre">mut</span> to <span class="pre">const</pre>).</li>
	<li><b>Implicit Conversion</b>.
	Although the numeric primitives are never subtypes of each other,
	a number of one type is <a href="refexpr.html#numrconv">automatically converted</a>
	to a different type, if required.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Another way to satisfy strict typing is to use methods that explicitly convert a value
	of one type into a different value of the required type.</p>
	
	<h2>Methods</h2>
	<p>Most types allow the definition of methods that apply to values of that type.
	Methods are simply functions whose definition is part of a type's declaration.
	The method's first parameter is named <span class="pre">self</span>.
	The type of <span class="pre">self</span> is either a value or reference of the type it belongs to.</p>
<pre>
struct Point
  x f32
  y f32
  // a method that works on Point values...
  fn len(self) f32
    ((.x*.x)+(.y*.y)).sqrt()

fn test()
  imm pt = Point{3., 4.}
  imm c = pt.len() // use Point's 'len' method
</pre>

	<h3>Constructor Methods</h3>
	<p>For some types, it is useful to have methods able to create a new value of a specific type.
	A type is allowed to define multiple constructor methods.
	By convention, the most commonly used constructor is called <span class="pre">init</span>.</p>
	<p>To represent that <span class="pre">self</span> needs to be created, 
	it should be marked with <span class="pre">new</span> and should declared its type as a reference. 
	The constructor should return self (otherwise, what's the point?).</p>
<pre>
struct Point
  x f32
  y f32
  fn init(new self &, x f32, y f32)
    self = Point{x,y}
	self
</pre>
	
	<h3>'drop' Method</h3>
	<p>Although it is not often needed, some types need the ability to
	perform some clean-up actions before a value is deleted
	(for example, releasing resources they have acquired).
	This clean-up activity should be performed within a method called <span class="pre">drop</span>.
