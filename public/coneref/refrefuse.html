	<h2>Reference Use (Dereferencing)</h2>
	<p>Use of a borrowed reference typically focuses only on the value it references.
	The <span class="pre">*</span> dereferencing operator may be used to handle this explicitly.
	Within expressions, dereferencing retrieves the value the reference points to.
  Used to the left of an assignment operator, dereferencing changes that value.</p>
<pre>
mut a = 3
imm ref = &amp;a    // ref holds a reference to a's contents
imm val = *ref  // val is now 3
*ref = 4        // a is now set to 4
</pre>

	<p>It is not always necessary to explicitly dereference a borrowed reference to use it,
	since a reference is understood to be a stand-in for the value it references.
	Dereferencing happens implicitly when using the <span class="pre">.</span> operator
	to access a field or call a method on some value pointed to by a reference:</p>
<pre>
mut a = -4
imm ptr = &amp;mut a
imm y = ptr.abs    // y is 4. Similar to: (*ptr).abs
</pre>
	<p>With method calls, it is important to note that self receives the the reference rather than the value.</p>
			
	<h2>Nullable References</h2>
	<p>By default, references can only point to valid values.
		However, it is possible to explicitly declare and use
		<a href="refnullref.html">nullable references</a>.
		A nullable reference can have the value <span class="pre">null</span>,
		which means the reference does not point to any valid value.</p>
		<p>The type signature for a nullable reference specifies a <span class="pre">?</span>
		after the ampersand:</p>
<pre>
imm ref4 &?i32		    	// borrowed, 'const' nullable reference
</pre>
		
		<p>To ensure safety, access to a nullable reference's value is only possible if
			the code first ensures the reference does not have the value of <span class="pre">null</span>:
		</p>
<pre>
// This condition is true only if maybePoint is not null ...
if (!maybePoint)
		imm point = *maybePoint // ... allowing us to obtain its value
imm point2 = *maybePoint    // **ERROR** We don't know if maybePoint is null here
</pre>
	
	<h2>Reference Operations</h2>
	<p>References are values. As such, they can be stored and passed around a program.
		Whether such transfers are simple copies or moves depends on the reference's type
		(particularly its permission and allocator).
		Reference transfers also check reference type information to ensure everyone is in agreement
		about what you can do with any passed-around reference.</p>
	<p>In general, references are treated as stand-ins for the values they refer to.
		Operations on references will nearly always apply to the value the reference refers to,
		rather than the references themselves.
	  However, there are a few operations which do operate directly on references:
		dereferencing, comparison, and reinterpretation.</p>

	<h3>De-referencing</h3>
	<p>As several examples have demonstrated, the <span class="pre">*</span> operator is used to access a reference's value.
		This is called de-referencing. De-referencing a reference is sometimes prohibited based on
		its permission or whether it might have null as a value.</p>
	<p>For most operations on a reference, a reference is automatically de-referenced before performing the operation.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
// Assume ref1 is a reference to an integer
imm sum = ref1 + 4        // equivalent to *ref1 + 4
</pre>

	<h3>Comparison</h3>
	<p>Two references may be compared for equality, but only if they have the same type signature</p>
<pre>
// Do ref1 and ref2 point to the same value?
if ref1 == ref2
    // do some stuff
</pre>
	<p>It is also possible to compare whether one pointer is greater than another.
		This is typically only meaningful if both refer to somewhere within the same object.</p>

	<h3>Reinterpretation</h3>
	<p>The 'as' operator may be used to take an existing reference and create a new reference
		with a different type signature.
		Whenever this might create some safety risks, use of the 'as' operator will need to happen within a 'trust' blocks.
	</p>
<pre>
imm newref = oldref as &Point  // Coerce a reference to a borrowed reference
</pre>
