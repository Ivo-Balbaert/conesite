	<p>After a program's source code gets big enough, 
		it may become easier to work with when partitioned across multiple files.
		Once we have done this, we need a way to stitch these fragments together.
		On this page, we introduce three such mechanisms for
		use when combining together logic from multiple source files.</p>

	<h2>include</h2>
	<p>The <span class="pre">include</span> statement
	incorporates another source file's contents 
	as if were part of the current source file's module.
	For example, suppose we had a source file called 'useme.cone':
<pre>
fn inc(a i32) i32:
  a+1
</pre>
		<p>Another source file can now use its contents:</p>
<pre>
include useme

fn timesnext(a i32):
  a * inc(a) // uses a function defined by 'useme.cone'
</pre>
	<p>Since the names declared inside any included file(s) are treated
		as part of the same module's namespace, each of the source files are
		free to reference each other's names.
		A source file should not be included more than once in a module.
		For clarity's sake, it is often best to place all includes near the
		top of the main source file for the module.</p>
	
	<h3>File names and Paths</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">include</span> statement specifies a file path.
		If the file path includes characters that are not legal for a Cone name
		(such as periods or slashes),
		it should be enclosed in double quotes 
		(and make use of the appropriate escape sequences where needed).
		If the file's extension is not specified, .cone is assumed.</p>
	<p>In the simplest case, the file path specifies just the name of a source file
		to be found in the same folder as the source file which includes it.
		If a file of that name is not found there, the compiler will look for it
		in a folder of the same name (e.g., "useme/useme.cone").
		This behavior allows source files to be organized across nested folders,
		where related source files are grouped together.</p>
	<p>If desired, the file path may explicitly specify folders in front of the source file name.
		This can be an absolute path name, such as "/libs/math/trigfns".
		It can also be relative to the source file doing the including,
		for example "nomnom/useme" or "../lib/useme".</p>
	
	<h2>import</h2>
	<p>Use <span class="pre">import</span> to import another module that has its own namespace.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
import math3d
import opengl
</pre>
	<p><span class="pre">import</span> uses the same file path guidelines
		as <span class="pre">include</span>.
		However, it is capable of a more robust search for the specified file.
		If it is not found in the current folder, it will search for it
		in the list of folders provided to the compiler when invoked.
		This allows the name of an imported module to correspond
		to some externally-hosted packaged library.</p>
	<p>More than one module may import the same module.
		The imported module will only be loaded once.
		Its information is then reused by all modules that imported it.</p>

	<h3>Module-qualified names</h3>
	<p>Unlike <span class="pre">include</span>,
		<span class="pre">import</span> is bringing in a module with its 
		own namespace. By default, the names of an imported module
		are kept separate from the names in the module doing the importing.
		The only name that the importing module automically obtains is the
		name of the module it is importing.</p>

	<p>Since the namespaces of the modules stay separated by default,
		the importing module normally refers to names inside the imported module
		using a module-qualified name:</p>
<pre>
import opengl

fn setColor(col Color):
  opengl::setColor(col)
</pre>
	<p><span class="pre">opengl::SetColor</span> references the <span class="pre">setColor</span>
		function to be found in the imported <span class="pre">opengl</span> module.
		The double-colon operator separates the module name from the name of the function
		defined in that module.</p>
	<p>Module-qualified names can only access public names.
		Names marked private (beginning with an underscore) are not accessible
		to any other module.</p>


	<h3>Namespace folding</h3>
	<p>By default, an imported module does not pollute the namespace of the module importing it.
		This is often what you want. However, it can become tedious to read (and type)
		module-qualified names when they are used a lot by the importing module's code.
		To address this, the <span class="pre">import</span> command provides several ways to fold
		some or all of its names into the importing module.
		The names being folded can be for anything: type, function, global variable, macro, etc.
		However, names folded in may not collide with any name the importing module already uses.</p>
	<p>To fold in just a few specific names, list them on the
		<span class="pre">import</span> command, separated by commas:</p>
<pre>
import math3d::Point3, Mat3

fn move(pos &amp;Point3, delta Point3):
  pos += delta
</pre>
	<p>Use <span class="pre">as</span> to provide an alias for a name that is already in use:</p>
<pre>
import math3d::Point3 as Point

fn move(pos &amp;Point, delta Point):
  pos += delta
</pre>
	<p>Or one can fold in all public names from the package using <span class="pre">*</span>:</p>
<pre>
import math3d::*

fn move(pos &amp;Point3, delta Point3):
  pos += delta
</pre>

<h2 id="extern">extern</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to make use of functions and global variables
	that have been implemented in another language, such as C.
	Since the Cone compiler cannot process source files written in another language,
	neither <span class="pre">include</span> nor <span class="pre">import</span> will suffice.
	Instead, an <span class="pre">extern</span> block must be used to
	declare these entities and their types so that Cone logic may make use of them.</p>
<pre>
extern
  // Functions
  fn printFloat(nbr f32)
  fn printInt(nbr i32)
  fn printString(str *u8) trust

  // Global variables
  mut indentation
</pre>
<p>The printString function has been marked
	as <a href="reftrust.html">trustable</a>.
	This indicates that we trust it to safely make use of the pointer it is given.
	If we had not done so, any attempt to call such a potentially unsafe
	<span class="pre">extern</span> function would require
	use of <span class="pre">trust</span>.</p>
<p>Although these <span class="pre">extern</span> names are effectively owned by some other module,
	this folds these names into the current module, 
	so that they can be used by any logic in this module.
	Since they are owned by another module, that module is responsible for
	initializing its global variables and implementing its functions.
	Thus, no functions in an <span class="pre">extern</span> block
	should be given implementation code, nor should variables be initialized.</p>

<h3>Associated types and methods</h3>
<p>Not uncommonly, external functions and variables depend on custom types and constants
	defined by the external module.
	If so, these types should also be declared in the <span class="pre">extern</span> block.
	Constants can be defined using an <span class="pre">enum</span>.
	If the internal field structure of a type is unknown,
	an <a href="refstruct.html#opaque">opaque <span class="pre">struct</span></a> may be used.</p>
<p>When custom types are defined, any externally defined function that take a value of
	that type as the first parameter may be declared as methods on that type.
	This allows the more convenient use of the dot operator when invoking
	functions on some data value.</p>

<h3>extern as include file</h3>
<p>It can be helpful to package the <span class="pre">extern</span> block
	for some C-compatible library (e.g., libcurl or sdl2) into its own file. 
	This allows every module that needs these declarations to obtain them
	via a simple <span class="pre">include</span>.</p>
