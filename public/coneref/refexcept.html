	<p>An exception occurs whenever a program tries to do something and fails.
		Sometimes, there is no graceful way to recover from certain exceptions.
		For example, maybe the program:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Needs more heap or stack memory and it is all used up.</li>
		<li>Encounters a math error, such as an overflow or divide by zero.</li>
		<li>Tries to access an out-of-bounds memory location.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When there is no obvious way to recover from an exception, the program "panics", 
		shutting shut down as quickly and gracefully as possible.
		Part of the shutdown process involves reporting on the nature of the failure
		so the logic problem that failed to prevent this problem can be fixed.</p>
	<p>In many cases, however, it is possible and desirable to recover from an
		exception. This page describes how.</p>

	<h2>Throwing Exceptions</h2>
	<p>Recoverable exceptions are always directly communicated from one function
		back to the function that called it.
		Instead of returning the expected value, it throws an exception value.</p>
<pre>
fn factorial(n i32) i32 throws Bool
  throw false if n &lt;= 0
  mut result = 1
  while n
    result *= n--
  result
</pre>
	<p>This function specifies <span class="pre">throws</span> as part of its signature
		to indicate that if it cannot successfully return an integer value,
		it will throw a boolean exception instead.
		The first line does exactly that: If the parameter is a negative number,
		it throws an exception value of <span class="pre">false</span>.</p>

	<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
	<p>Now that we have a function that can throw an exception,
		let's show different ways to handle it.</p>
	
	<h3>Give exception a default value</h3>

	<p>Use the <span class="pre">||</span> operator to establish
		a default value in the event of a thrown exception.</p>
<pre>
fn calc(n i32) i32
  factorial(n) || 0
</pre>
	<p>If <span class="pre">factorial</span> throws an exception,
		it is treated as if it had returned 0 instead.
		The value to the right of the operator must be a plain value,
		and its type must match that of the success value on the left.</p>

	<h3>Panic on exception</h3>
	<p>Use the <span class="pre">?</span> operator following any call 
		to an exception-throwing function.</p>
<pre>
fn calc(n i32) i32
  try factorial(n)? + 10
</pre>
	<p>This checks whether the function call succeeds
		and returns a value. If so, it adds 10 to that result and returns it.
		Since this function gives no clue on how to handle an exception,
		the default behavior on a thrown exception will be that the program
		panics and shuts down.</p>

	<h3>Exception propagation</h3>
	<p>Another approach involves
		re-throwing the exception to the next caller up the call stack.</p>
<pre>
fn calc(n i32) i32 throws Bool
  factorial(n)? + 10
</pre>
	<p>Even though this function still does not specify an exception handler,
		its signature shows that it also throws exceptions.
		As a result, if the call to factorial throws an exception,
		that exception will be re-thrown to the function which called
		<span class="pre">calc</span>.
		Importantly, there must be a type match between the exception value
		received and the one the function re-throws.</p>
	
	<h3>catch exception handlers</h3>
	<p>If we want some other behavior than panic or re-throw,
		one or more exception handlers must be specified in the form of
		a <span class="pre">catch</span> blocks.
		This block appears at some point after the
		<span class="pre">try</span>, but need not be
		immediately afterwards.</p>
<pre>
fn calc(n i32) i32
  factorial(n)? + 10
	
  catch
    0
</pre>
	<p>Should the call to <span class="pre">factorial</span>
		throw an exception, the <span class="pre">catch</span>
		block handler will be run. In this case, it returns the number 0.
		In effect, we have completely recovered from the thrown exception,
		as this <span class="pre">calc</span> itself throws no exception.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, we could handle it by throwing an
		exception of a different type or value.</p>
<pre>
fn calc(n i32) i32 throws i32
  factorial(n)? + 10
	
  catch
    throw 0
</pre>
	<p>If we need more information about the exception,
		a variable name (and optionally a type) may also be specified on 
		the <span class="pre">catch</span> statement.
		This binds to the exception value, so that it may be interrogated:
	</p>
<pre>
fn calc(n i32) i32 throws i32
  factorial(n)? + 10

  catch err
    if err
      panic
    else
      throw 0
</pre>
	<p>This handler will trigger a <span class="pre">panic</span>
		if the thrown exception value is <span class="pre">false</span>.
		Otherwise, it will throw a new exception value of 0.</p>

	<h2>Intentional Panics</h2>
	<p>Recovering from a thrown exception may be possible and the right thing to do
		in certain circumstances.
		However, sometimes the right response to a bad condition
		is to intentionally shut the program down.
		As shown above, one way to do this is using the
		<span class="pre">panic</span> statement.</p>

	<h3>assert and requires</h3>
	<p>The assert statement triggers a panic when its condition
		evaluates to false.</p>
<pre>
assert idx &lt; bound
</pre>
	<p><span class="pre">assert</span> is only performed in test builds.
	To get the equivalent guarantee in production as well:</p>
<pre>
requires idx &lt; bound
</pre>

	<h3>Contract conditions</h3>
	<p>Where we want a function to preserve some invariants on entry
		and exit from the function, the
		<span class="pre">requires</span> and <span class="pre">ensures</span>
		clauses may be added to a function signature.
		These provide a visibly strengthened contract that governs use of the
		function. If these conditions fail, a panic is triggered.</p>
<pre>
fn factorial(n i32) i32 \
  requires n &gt; 0        \
  ensures result &gt; 0

  mut result = 1
  while n
    result *= n--
  result
</pre>
	<p>This function expects that it will get a positive, non-zero number
		and return the same. Any other behavior is a bug which we
		want to catch quickly in testing and fix.</p>
