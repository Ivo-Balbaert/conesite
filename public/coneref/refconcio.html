	<p>Generally speaking, work requests that make use of blocking i/o
		should be performed on an extra native thread so as to not degrade the
		throughput and latency of non-blocking work.
		It is possible that functions will be annotated (like purity) such that
		the compiler can detect whether a thread is known to not block.</p>

	<p>A common use of such yielding co-routines is when a work thread wants to
		issue non-blocking i/o requests. Any i/o functions it uses
		automatically yield after submitting the i/o request, suspending work on the co-routine.
		After the i/o thread determines the i/o request has been handled,
		it triggers the co-routine to be rescheduled and resumed, 
		feeding it the appropriate Result from that request.</p>
