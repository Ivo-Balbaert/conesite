	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: None of this is implemented or really designed.
		Thus, this text is exploratory in nature, for now.</i></p>

	<p>I/O encompasses any processing activity that extends beyond the boundaries of CPU/memory computation,
		including user input and presentation, file or network requests, timers, etc.
		From the perspective of the CPU, I/O activity can often take a long, indeterminate amount of time,
		which presents a complicating challenge to efficiently scheduling concurrent work.</p>
	<p>In essence, we want to satisfy these essential requirements:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>We don't want I/O activity to block the CPU from performing other available work.</li>
	<li>When any I/O activity reports progress, we often want to continue processing where we left off,
		based on a remembered execution and data state (context).</li>
	<li>We sometimes want the option to "cancel" already-requested i/o work based on time-outs, failures or other changed conditions.
		Sometimes, we want to cascade cancellation through multiple levels of already-submitted requests.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>There are several architectural approaches to satisfy these requirements:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Async/Await.</b>
		I/O requests are always issued asynchronously (non-blocking), whose returned type is a promise.
		When I/O finishes or fails, the promise fires the appropriate pre-determined logic. 
		<p>Syntactic sugar is used to hide the complexity of
		the promise handling, so that the "before" and "after" code look like a single block of sequential code.
		Under the covers, they are actually independent logic, with the context of the "before" code captured as
		an implicit closure that is passed as a continuation to the "after" code.</p>
		<p>There are two significant drawbacks to this approach:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>async/await logic infects all functions/methods above it in the execution stack</li>
		<li>There is no graceful way to implement cancellability</li>
		</ul></li>
		
	<li><b>Gothreads.</b>
		I/O requests are synchronous (blocking). It is up to the runtime scheduler to detect that a gothread 
		is effectively blocked on i/o and effectively re-balance work so that other gothreads keep all CPUs busy.
		<p>Although this approach avoids the infectious coloring issue of async/await
			and is easier on the programmer (no extra annotations), it has its own drawbacks:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The runtime logic needed to detect that a gothread is blocked on i/o is not cheap, quick or foolproof.
			The same holds true for the reverse, noticing when the gothread becomes unblocked.
			As a result, this approach is likely slower than an equivalent async/await implementation.</li>
		<li>There is no graceful way to implement cancellability</li>
		</ul>
		
	<li><b>Actors.</b>
		Whenever multi-step i/o is required, the requesting actor (Requester) spawns a new actor (Workflow).
			Part of the spawning message is the id of the Requester actor to return the final result to.
			Workflow issues i/o requests as asynchronous messages to some environmental i/o actor.
			Completed (or failed) i/o are sent as messages to the Workflow actor who can use its preserved
			context to know what to do next. When the Workflow actor is finished with all its processing,
			it returns a response to the Requester workflow as a message.</p>
		<p>Like async/await, this uses continuation-passing style. In this case, the continuation is an actor (and its state)
			able to support multiple kinds of messages. Since the actor accepts asynchronous messages from
			any actor, it can also support the notion of a cancel message, and even the ability to pass that
			cancel message on, dependending on its state. Unlike async/await, there is no notion of infectious
			function colors up the execution stack, as all actors are already found at the top of the execution stack from the
			point-of-view of the runtime scheduler.</p>
		<p>The primary challenge of this approach is that it requires the programmer to manage
			the concurrent workflow explicitly with actors. This may be a challenge for programmers
			who are only familiar with synchronous-style programming.</p></li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>Currently, the projected design for Cone is leaning towards an Actor-based approach for handling asynchronous I/O,
		sequential workflows, and cancellability.</p>
