	<p>Inheritance makes it easy to declare
		a new type that reuses (inherits) the fields or methods defined by some other type.</p>
	<p>Cone's version of inheritance looks and behaves somewhat differently than
		in other languages.
		At its heart, Cone's inheritance is a composition-based approach that offers
		convenient namespace "sugar" for automatically forwarding certain field or method access requests.
		This makes customized type reuse easy to accomplish, where needed,
		while side-stepping the tightly-coupled complexity and fragility 
		sometimes experienced when using traditional inheritance.</p>

	<h2>Selective Inheritance</h2>
	<p>Imagine we have this <span class="pre">Engine</span> type:</p>
<pre>
struct Engine
  fuel   f32
  torque f32

  fn thrust(amt f32) { ... }
  fn power(on Bool) { ... }
</pre>

	<p>Now, let's create a new <span class="pre">Car</span> type that includes, 
		and inherits from, an <span class="pre">Engine</span>:</p>
<pre>
struct Car
  engine Engine use fuel, thrust
  body   SportyLook
  wheels RimWheels
</pre>
	<p>The use of the <span class="pre">use</span> keyword on the <span class="pre">engine</span>
		field ensures that every Car object inherits the 
		<span class="pre">fuel</span> field and <span class="pre">thrust</span> method
		from <span class="pre">Engine</span> by way of <span class="pre">engine</span>. 
		Effectively, we are requesting automatic namespace-forwarding magic, such that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>any access to <span class="pre">car.fuel</span>
			is treated as equivalent to <span class="pre">car.engine.fuel</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="pre">car.thrust(23.2)</span>
			is treated as equivalent to <span class="pre">car.engine.thrust(23.2)</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>A type may inherit names from more than one field.</p>

	<h3>Name Aliasing</h3>
	<p>Inherited names must be unique. It is an error to inherit names that are
		otherwise defined by the type. Similarly, it is an error to inherit the same
		name from two different fields.</p>
	<p>To avoid such name conflicts, a name may be inherited using an alias.
		For example <span class="pre">use fuel as fuelamt, thrust</span> would support
		the use of <span class="pre">car.fuelamt</span> as an alias for 
		<span class="pre">car.engine.fuel</span>.</p>

	<h2>Total Inheritance</h2>
	<p>If a field specifies <span class="pre">use *</span>, all fields are inherited.
		Additionally, this inherits every method not explicitly implemented by the new type.
		For example:
	</p>
<pre>
struct SuperEngine
  engine Engine use *
  fn power(on Bool) { ... }
</pre>
	<p><span class="pre">SuperEngine</span> inherits the fields
		<span class="pre">fuel</span> and <span class="pre">torque</span>, 
		as well as the <span class="pre">thrust</span> method from <span class="pre">engine</span>.
		It does not inherit the <span class="pre">power</span> method,
		since it has its own implementation of it.</p>

	<p>When a type inherits all the fields of another type, 
		its constructor may name those fields individually or collectively.
	  Thus, <span class="pre">SuperEngine[engine: Engine[fuel: 1.0, torgue: 2.0]]</span>
		and <span class="pre">SuperEngine[fuel: 1.0, torgue: 2.0]</span>
		are equivalent and equally acceptable.</p>
