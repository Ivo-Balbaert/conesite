	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>All of this is implemented except embedded traits.</i></p>
	
	<p>Like <span class="pre">struct</span><span class="pre">, trait</span>
		and <span class="pre">enumtrait</span>
		define a new type composed of named fields and methods.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
trait Node
  id u32
  fn print()
</pre>
	<p>Traits differ from structs in two important ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is not possible to use a constructor of this type
			(e.g., <span class="pre">imm node = Node[12]</span> is illegal).</li>
		<li>A trait may define methods that have no implementation logic (virtual methods),
			as the <span class="pre">print</span> method demonstrates.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Traits are versatile, supporting many roles. 
		On this page, we will focus on using traits to create variant, concrete types
		that share common fields, methods, and <a href="#marker">marker</a> attributes.
		Future pages will address other valuable uses of traits:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="refvirtref.html"><b>Virtual references</b></a>,
			to access fields or use methods of values whose concrete
			types we won't know until run-time.</li>
		<li><a href="refconstraint.html"><b>Generic constraints</b></a>, to declare which types
			generic type or function can safely support, when instantiated.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="inherit">Trait-based Variant Types</h2>
	<p>Although <span class="pre">enum</span> is sufficient for simple variant types,
		we sometimes need more complex variant types that
		share fields in common or support same-named methods which are implemented
		differently for each variant.
		We accomplish this by defining each variant types as inheriting from
		a common base <span class="pre">trait</span> or <span class="pre">enumtrait</span>.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
// Common base trait for variant event types
// 'enumtrait' pads all variants to be the same size
enumtrait Event
  enum u8     // explicit tag field to discriminate variants
  time Time   // All events are time-stamped

// Mouse event type, inheriting from Event
struct MouseEvent : Event
  button u8
  x i32
  y i32

// Keystroke event type
struct KeyEvent : Event
  key KeySym

// Quit event type
struct QuitEvent : Event
</pre>
	<p>This example defines three variant event types
		(for mouse-button clicks, keyboard changes, and quit requests),
		all built on a common Event base trait.
		These event types share some fields in common, such as
		<span class="pre">time</span>'s timestamp info.
		Each event variant may also have its own specific fields.
		All event values take up the same amount of memory.</p>

	<h3>Trait type</h3>
	<p>Let's unpack details by focusing first on the definition of the trait type.</p>

	<h4>trait vs. enumtrait</h4>
	<p>The only difference between <span class="pre">enumtrait</span> and <span class="pre">trait</span>
		is that <span class="pre">enumtrait</span> ensures that all variant types are the same size.
		(This is the same guarantee <span class="pre">enum</span> makes for its variants.)
		Since <span class="pre">MouseEvent</span> is the largest variant type in the above example,
		<span class="pre">Event</span>'s use of <span class="pre">enumtrait</span> ensures the size of
		<span class="pre">KeyEvent</span> and <span class="pre">QuitEvent</span> are padded to be as large.
		To successfully calculate this, <span class="pre">enumtrait</span> requires that all
		variant types be defined in the same module as the trait.</p>
	<p>If all variants have the same size, one may work with trait-typed values 
		either as values (<span class="pre">Event</span>) 
		or as references (<span class="pre">&Event</span>). 
		When variants have different sizes, a trait type may only be used as a reference.
		Being able to work with a trait type as a value offers some performance and other benefits:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>One variant type's value may be replaced (in place)
			with a value of a different variant type.</li>
		<li>The pool region may be used to more quickly allocate
				space for any new value, regardless of the concrete variant type.</li>
		<li>Access to field information is faster for values than when using references.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When <span class="pre">trait</span> is used instead of <span class="pre">enumtrait</span>,
		two key benefits accrue:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Variant types may be defined in different modules than the trait type.</li>
		<li>Memory waste may be less than with fixed-size variant types,
			as each variant type only takes as much space as it requires.
			This may matter when variant types vary greatly in size and are used in great numbers.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Tag field</h4>
	<p>The <span class="pre">Event </span> trait above uses
		<span class="pre">enum u8</span> to explicitly specify
		that all its variant types will carry a tag field at this position and size.
		(This is the same tag field that <span class="pre">enum</span>
		implicitly defines for all its variants.)</p>
	<p>The tag field's only use is to make pattern matching possible on a
		variant type value (<span class="pre">Event</span>) 
		or basic reference (<span class="pre">&Event</span>),
		as the tag's integer value uniquely discriminates which variant type a value currently holds.
		So, if no such pattern matching is expected 
		(e.g., because virtual references will be used instead),
		there is no need to define a tag field in the trait.</p>
	<p>The primary benefit of having a tag field,
		is that tag-based pattern matching will likely
		perform better than virtual reference dispatch.
		The presence of a tag field also means one can use a basic reference
		to the trait type (<span class="pre">&Event</span>), rather than having to
		use a more expensive virtual reference (<span class="pre">&amp;&lt;Event</span>).</p>
	<p>The downsides of the tag field is the extra memory space it requires
		and the restriction that all variant types
		must be defined in the same module as the trait they inherit from.
		This requirement ensures the compiler
		can easily calculate exactly how many variants there are and
		assign each one a different unique integer number.</p>
	<p>Although it occupies space like other fields, it has no name because its contents are not
		accessible nor changeable in the same way as other fields.
		The tag field's content is implicitly and correctly initialized by the variant type's constructor.</p>
	
	<h4>Common Fields</h4>
	<p>A trait's fields are inherited by all its variants,
		accessible just like any other field in the variant.
		Because a tagged trait's common fields are located in the same place across all variants,
		pattern matching is never required to access them.</p>

	<h4>Common Methods</h4>
	<p>Traits may define methods. 
		These methods may have implementations, but they are not required to.
		A trait's method without an implementation must be implemented by all variant types.
		A trait's method with an implementation is used as the default implementation
		for a variant type, if that variant type does not override it with its own implementation.</p>

	<h3>Variant Types from base traits</h3>
	<p>Now let's examine the definition and use of concrete variant types
		which inherit from a base trait type. 
		These are defined using <span class="pre">struct</span>,
		thereby specific values of these variant types can be instantiated.</p>

	<h4>Inheriting from a Base Trait</h4>
	<p>A variant struct type explicitly inherits from a base trait
		by specifying it after the struct name and a colon.
		A trait's fields are folded into the struct at the start,
		as if individually specified there.</p>
	<p>There are restrictions to base trait inheritance:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Only the base trait may specify a tag field (and only one of them).</li>
		<li>Only the lowest base trait may be 'enumtrait' (same-size). All other traits are 'trait'.</li>
		<li>The name of every field must be unique, whether inherited or part of the variant type.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Fields and Methods</h4>
	<p>Each variant type may define its own unique fields. Similarly, it may define its own methods.
		Every trait method without an implementation must be implemented by the variant type.
		Any implemented trait method may be overridden by the variant type,
		otherwise the default trait's method applies.</p>

	<h4>Variant Type Values</h4>
	<p>Since a variant type is a struct, one works with it as with most any struct.
	A new value is created using a struct constructor specifying both the common fields and the
	variant type's unique fields (any tag is automatically filled in with the correct integer):</p>
<pre>
// Notice that all constructors must provide a timestamp for the common time field
mut event = MouseEvent[time: now, button: 0, x: 140, y: 170]
event = KeyEvent[now, 'a']
event = QuitEvent[now]
</pre>
	<p>If the variant type is based on an <span class="pre">enumtrait</span>,
		the type of its values could be the name of the trait 
		(e.g., <span class="pre">Event</span>). Common fields may be accessed in the usual way.
		However, unique fields and methods are only accessible after 
		<a href="refmatch.html">pattern matching</a>.</p>
<pre>
match event
  ~~ mbutton = MouseButton:   mbutton.x
  ~~ key = Keyboard:          i32[key.keysym]
  ~~ Quit:                    0
</pre>
	<p>If the variant type is based on <span class="pre">trait</span>,
	  its type is the name of the variant type
		(e.g., <span class="pre">QuitEvent</span>).
		Common and unique fields and methods are accessed in the usual way.</p>
	
	<h4>Upcasting to a Trait Reference</h4>
	<p>A basic reference to a base trait may be safely coerced from a reference to any variant type's value.</p>
<pre>
imm refevent &amp;Event = &event
</pre>
	<p>(Note: On the next page, we also show that a trait-based virtual reference may be created.)</p>
	<p>A trait-based basic reference only has access to the trait's common fields
		and any trait-based implemented methods never overwritten by any variant type.</p>
<pre>
imm when = refevent.time
</pre>
	<p>Use pattern-matching to downcast it to its original variant type.</p>
<pre>
if imm butevent &MouseButton = refevent
  // We can safely use butevent here as a reference to a event known to be a MouseButton event
</pre>

	<h3>Inheriting from a non-base trait</h3>
	<p>A struct may inherit from multiple traits, but only one of them may be designated as the base trait.</p>
<pre>
struct Composite : BaseTrait
	embed AnotherTrait
	afield i32
</pre>
  <p>This struct inherits from two traits, BaseTrait and AnotherTrait.
		However, only BaseTrait is used as a base trait.</p>
	<p>A trait that is embedded (like AnotherTrait) is fully inherited in the same way as a base trait.
		It includes all its fields as if defined in the struct.
		Likewise, all its methods are also inherited (although they may be overridden by the struct's 
		(or other inherited trait/struct) methods.</p>
	<p>Unlike the base trait, embedded traits may not be same-sized nor may they define a tag field.
		Also, one may not upcast the struct (or a basic reference to the struct) to any embedded trait.
		This latter restriction is because there is no guarantee on where the embedded trait's fields
		will be found in the struct, not to mention the restriction that trait values are never instantiated.
		As will be seen later, it is possible to create a virtual reference to an embedded trait.</p>

	
	<h2 id="marker">Marker traits</h2>
	<p>A marker trait defines no fields nor methods.
		Its value comes from other trait or struct types inheriting it.
		Its use then becomes a testable attribute of that type (e.g., by generics), 
		allowing one to distinguish between types that support
		a certain behavior and those that don't.</p>
