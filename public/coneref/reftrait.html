	<p>Traits look so much like structs, no one would blame you for being confused:</p>
<pre>
trait Eq
  fn `==`(a Self, b Self) Bool
</pre>
	<p>This trait defines no fields and only a single method that overloads the
		<span class="pre">==</span> operator. 
		Unlike a struct, however, no implementation is given for the method.
		Even stranger, no variable may declare its value as having the
		<span class="pre">Eq</span> type:</p>
<pre>
imm anEqValue Eq    // *** ERROR ***
</pre>
	<p>Traits are a different kind of type.
		Whereas <span class="pre">struct</span>, <span class="pre">enum</span>, 
		etc. enable the creation of concrete types,
		<span class="pre">trait</span> is used to create abstract types.
		Abstract types play an indirect role as a catalyst for new capabilities.
		Using an abstract type (like <span class="pre">Eq</span>), 
		we improve the reusability features of any concrete type
		whose structure conforms to <span class="pre">Eq</span>.
		In particular, traits facilitate:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="refvirtref.html"><b>Virtual references</b></a>,
			enabling access to fields or methods of values whose concrete
			types we won't know until run-time.</li>
		<li><a href="refinherit.html"><b>Inheritance</b></a>, for making it easier to create concrete types
			that share common implementations for fields and methods.</li>
		<li><a href="refmarker.html"><b>Type markers</b></a>, to distinguish between types that support
			a certain behavior and those that forbid it.</li>
		<li><a href="refconstraint.html"><b>Generic constraints</b></a>, to help detect whether a type is
			supported for expansion by a specific generic type or function.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A trait may loosely be compared to a filter that allows us to
		see into the fields, methods and constrained behavior of other
		compliant types. By compliant, we simply mean that for each and
		every field and method defined by the trait, we can find
		exactly the same field or method defined in the compliant type.
		The compliant type may implement more fields and methods,
		but it must implement at least the ones the trait defines.</p>
