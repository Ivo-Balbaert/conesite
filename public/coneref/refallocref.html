    <div class="text">

	<p>A program's memory is partitioned into regions,
			each with its own strategy for allocating and reclaiming memory for values.
			Every program value is wholly located within and governed by its owning region.</p>
	<p>For example, space for all variable values are automatically allocated
			in either:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Global region</b>.
			All global variable values are stored here at fixed locations.</li>
		<li><b>Execution Stack regions</b>.
			Local variable values are allocated and de-allocated here in LIFO order
			as execution unfolds.
			Each execution thread has its own stack region.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Cone offers additional region types that are explicitly used to dynamically allocate space for new values,
		such as <span class="pre">&amp;rc</span> (reference counting), <span class="pre">&amp;gc</span> (tracing GC),
		<span class="pre">&amp;ar</span> (arena) and <span class="pre">&amp;one</span> (single owner).
		Later pages will describe these and other region types in detail,
		along with offering guidelines for selecting which to use when.</p>
	<p>First, however, we need to understand owning references,
		the handles we use to work with values dynamically allocated by regions.
		All owning references point to some valid, allocated value.
		This page describes how owning references are created and used.</p>

	<h2>Creating Owning References</h2>
	<p>Let's ask a region to allocate a new value and give us back an owning reference:</p>
<pre>
imm nbrref = &amp;rc imm 4
</pre>
	<p>This uses the ampersand operator to dynamically allocate and initialize a new value,
		specifying:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Region</b> which allocates the value and manages its lifetime.
			In this case, the value is allocated in the <span class="pre">rc</span> region.</li>
		<li><b>Permission</b>. As with variables, this governs access to the value.
			<span class="pre">imm</span> allows views but not changes.
			(<b>Note:</b> <span class="pre">uni</span> is assumed when no permission is specified.)
		</li>
		<li><b>Initial Value</b>.
			A copy of this value is stored in the newly allocated memory location.
			In this case, it is the integer 4.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>What we get back from this allocation is an owning reference, 
		which this example stores	in the variable <span class="pre">nbrref</span>.
		The inferred type of this reference looks similar to the allocation:
		<span class="pre">&amp;rc imm i32</span>.
		This type signature includes the type of the initial value as the reference's value type.</p>
	<p>A type's constructor or <a href="refinitdrop.html">initializer</a> may be specified
		as the initial value.</p>
<pre>
imm gcref = &amp;gc mut Point3[1f, 2f, 3f]  // Allocate a new Point3 value using a constructor
</pre>
				
	<h4>Reference vs. Variable Permissions</h4>
	<p>To avoid confusion, let's clarify the role that permissions play with references.
		The permission on a reference governs that reference itself:
		what you can or cannot do with the value that the reference points to.
		This is distinct and separate from the role of the permission on
		any variable that holds a reference, which governs what we can do with the variable.</p>
	<p>To illustrate this, consider these variations:</p>
<pre>
imm ref1 = &amp;rc imm 3
imm ref2 = &amp;rc mut 3
mut ref3 = &amp;rc imm 3
mut ref4 = &amp;rc mut 3
</pre>
	<p>Because of the <span class="pre">mut</span> variable permission,
		<span class="pre">ref3</span> and <span class="pre">ref4</span>
		may be changed to hold a different reference.
		<span class="pre">ref1</span> and <span class="pre">ref2</span> cannot.
	</p>
<pre>
ref1 = &amp;rc imm 5   // ** ILLEGAL! **
ref2 = &amp;rc mut 5   // ** ILLEGAL! **
ref3 = &amp;rc imm 5   // ok
ref4 = &amp;rc mut 5   // ok
</pre>
	<p>In contrast, because of the <span class="pre">mut</span> reference permission,
		the references in <span class="pre">ref2</span> and <span class="pre">ref4</span>
		may be changed to point to a different value.
		The values pointed to by <span class="pre">ref1</span> and <span class="pre">ref3</span> cannot be altered.
	</p>
<pre>
*ref1 = 5   // ** ILLEGAL! **
*ref2 = 5   // ok
*ref3 = 5   // ** ILLEGAL! **
*ref4 = 5   // ok
</pre>

	<h3>Creating Multiple References to the Same Value</h3>
	<p>The creation of the <i>first</i> owning reference to a new value always comes from an allocation, as shown above.
		Additional owning references to that value may then be created
		by copying an existing reference via assignment or function calls:</p>
<pre>
imm nbrref = &amp;rc imm 4
imm nbrref2 = nbrref        // nbrref2 and nbrref point to same value
</pre>

	<h3>How References and Allocations Expire</h3>
	<p>Owning references keep the value they point to alive.
		So long as a value has at least one owning reference that points to it,
		the value's region will not dispose of the value and reclaim its memory space.
		Only when all references to a value expire does the region have the right to free the value
		(although how quickly this happens varies by region).</p>
	<p>So, when does the lifetime of an owning reference expire?
		When the data structure it is bound to expires or changes its value.
		If the reference is never stored anywhere, it is consumed by the expression it is part of
		and expires nearly immediately.
		If the reference is stored in a variable, it expires no later than the end of the
		lexical scope that variable is declared within
		(and sooner, obviously, if the variable takes on a new value).
		If the reference is pointed at by another reference,
		then the lifetime of the former depends on the lifetime of the latter.</p>
	<p>When all references to an allocated value expire 
		and the region has decided to reclaim the value's space, 
		the region will automatically invoke the value's 
		<a href="refinitdrop.html">finalizer</a>, if it has been defined.</p>

	<h2 id="ops">Reference Operations</h2>
	<p>The de-referencing and comparison operators may be directly applied to references.</p>

	<h3>De-referencing</h3>
	<p>The most common use of references is to access and work with the value it points to.
		Accessing this value is called de-referencing.
  	To explicitly de-reference, use the <span class="pre">*</span> operator.
		Within expressions, dereferencing retrieves the value the reference points to.
		Used to the left of an assignment operator, dereferencing changes that value.</p>
<pre>
imm ref = &amp;rc mut 3
imm val = *ref  // val is now 3
*ref = 4        // ref now points to the value of 4
</pre>
	<p>De-referencing is only permitted if the reference's permission allows it.
		Certain permissions, such as <span class="pre">opaq</span> and the locked permissions,
		disallow de-referencing.</p>

	<h3>Comparison</h3>
	<p>Two references may be compared for equality, even if they do not have the same type signature.
		What this test determines is whether both references point to the same value:
	</p>
<pre>
// Do ref1 and ref2 point to the same value?
if ref1 == ref2
		// do some stuff
</pre>
	<p>It is also possible to compare whether one reference is "greater" than another.
		This compares their respective memory addresses.
		This might only be meaningful if both refer to somewhere within the same object.</p>

	<h2 id="handle">Reference Handling</h2>
	<p>References are values. As such, they can be stored and passed around a program.
		Whether such transfers are simple copies or moves depends on the reference's permission
		(move semantics apply to all references having the <a href="refmove.html">uni</a> permission).
		Reference transfers also check reference type information to ensure everyone is in agreement
		about what you can do with any passed-around reference.</p>
	<p>Even though references are typed values,
		they do sometimes get some special treatment to make them more convenient to use,
		particularly to enable them to act as stand-ins for the values they point to.</p>

	<h3>Reference Method Definitions</h3>
	<p>Methods may be defined that accept references as the type for <span class="pre">self</span>.
		However, importantly, such methods must be defined as part of the
		<b>value type's</b> collection of methods.
		Thus, if we want to define a method that works on a reference to a
		<span class="pre">Point</span>, that method must be defined within the collection
		of methods for the <span class="pre">Point</span> type:</p>
<pre>
struct Point
  // .. other Point methods here

  // method that accepts a reference to a Point
  fn normalize(self &rc mut Point)
    imm len = self.len
    x /= len
    y /= len
    z /= len
</pre>

	<h3>Implicit De-referencing</h3>
	<p>Since a reference is generally understood to be a stand-in for the value it references,
		de-referencing often happens implicitly.
	  For example, when the dot operator is applied to a reference to access a field, 
		the reference is automatically de-referenced:</p>
<pre>
imm ref = &amp;rc mut Point[1f, 2f, 3f]
imm y = ref.y // equivalent to: (*ref).y
</pre>
	<p>Automatic de-referencing might also happen when applying
		a method to a reference. For example:</p>
<pre>
imm ref = &amp;rc mut -4.
imm pos = ref.abs    // pos is 4. Equivalent to: (*ref).abs
imm sum = ref + 4.   // sum is 0. Equivalent to *ref1 + 4.
</pre>
	<p>With methods, the decision on whether or not to implicitly de-reference
		depends on what is supported by implemented methods.
		If an existing method can accept the reference as a reference, it is used.
		If not, the reference is de-referenced before applying the method.</p>
				
	<h3>Nullable References</h3>
	<p>References only ever point to valid values.
		However, it is possible to explicitly declare and use nullable references,
		much like any other <a href="refenum.html#nullable">nullable value</a>.</p>
<pre>
imm ref4 ?&amp;rc imm i32		 // nullable reference to an integer
</pre>
	<p>In addition to pointing to a valid value, a nullable reference
		may also have the value <span class="pre">null</span>,
		which means the reference does not point to any valid value.
	  To ensure safety, access to a nullable reference's value is only possible if
		the code first ensures the reference does not have the value of <span class="pre">null</span>:
	</p>
<pre>
// This condition is true only if maybePoint is not null ...
if maybePoint
		imm point = *maybePoint // ... allowing us to obtain its value
imm point2 = *maybePoint    // **ERROR** We don't know if maybePoint is null here
</pre>
	<p><b>Note:</b> A special optimization ensures that nullable references are the same size
		as regular references.</p>
