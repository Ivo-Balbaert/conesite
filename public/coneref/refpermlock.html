	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>No lock permission support exists.</i></p>
	
	<p>Earlier we talked about the static permissions. In addition to these are lock permissions,
		which can only be used on region-managed references.
		Unlike static permissions, which are built-in compiler primitives,
		lock permissions are library-implemented.</p>
	<p>Lock permissions are needed when we want to guarantee that only one
		reference can change or multiple references can read the object value at-a-time
		(aliasability xor mutability).
		This is accommodated by having borrowing acquire the lock before
		the underlying value can be de-referenced for read or write operation.
		When the borrowed reference expires, the lock is automatically released.</p>

	<h2>List of Permissions</h2>
	
	<h3>mutex</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">mutex</span> permission 
		enables multiple, mutable references to be shared across threads.
		A <span class="pre">mutex</span> reference itself 
		cannot directly access or change the value it points to,
		except by using atomic operations.</p>
	<p>To obtain direct access to the value, one must first obtain a 
		<a href="refborref.html">borrowed reference</a>
		from the <span class="pre">mutex</span> reference.
		Obtaining the borrowed reference automatically acquires a runtime lock
		that ensures only one reference at a time can 
		view or modify the value the reference points to.</p>
<pre>
imm point = +gc-mutex Point(x:2, y: 3)
{
  pointref = &mut *point     // Obtain borrowed ref to unlock access to the point
	pointref.x += pointref.y   // Access to point safely protected by mutex
}
</pre>
	<p>When the borrowed reference expires, so does the acquired lock.</p>

	<h3>rwlock</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">rwlock</span> permission
		works very much the same way as <span class="pre">mutex</span>,
		except that it allows multiple read-only borrowed references to be obtained
		at the same time. 
		However, only one mutable borrowed reference may be obtained at a time.</p>

	<h3>rwcell</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">rwcell</span> permission
		is quite similar to <span class="pre">rwlock</span>,
		except that all its reference copies are constrained to say in a single thread.
		This is useful when one withes to serialize at runtime the acquisition
		of interior references to variant or collection values.</p>
