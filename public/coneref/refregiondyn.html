		<h3>arena - Regional</h3>
		<p>This strategy makes efficient use of a pre-allocated (and growable) arena of memory.
			Every new allocation takes a bite out of this arena using a fast bump pointer.
			Allocations are never individually freed. The entire slab is freed as a single event 
			when the arena itself goes out of scope.</p>
		<p>The primary benefit is speed: allocation and free are much faster
			than malloc or equivalent, and there are no run-time bookkeeping costs.
			The chief drawbacks are memory waste (because nothing is freed until the arena goes out of scope)
			and the inability to support drop finalizers.</p>
	
		<h3>pool - Fixed-size Pool</h3>
		<p>Similar to arena, this strategy makes use of a pre-allocated (and growable) memory area
			that has been divided up into identically-sized slots.
			Each new allocation quickly grabs some unused slot.
			Reference counting is used to determine when an allocation is freed (marking its slot as reusable).</p>
		<p>The primary benefit of pool is memory efficiency and 
			a much faster allocation and free of size-limited values than is possible using malloc.
			The chief drawbacks are the size limits on values
				and the runtime bookkeeping costs of its underlying lifetime algorithm.</p>
