    <div class="text">

	<p><span class="pre">if</span> are control structures
	that determine which code block to perform based on the evaluated result of one or more conditional expressions.</p>
	
	<h3 id="if">if</h3>
	<p>In this heavily commented example, the code block to perform is determined
	by comparing a combined roll of two die with 7:</p>
<pre>
// Is roll equal to 7?
if roll == 7
  // If so, assign result to "Perfect"
  result = "Perfect"

// Otherwise ("else if"), is roll less than 7?
elif roll &lt; 7
  // If so, assign result to "Too low!"
  result = "Too low!"

// Otherwise (since the roll is not 7 nor less than 7)
else
  // Assign result to "Too high!"
  result = "Too high!"
</pre>
	<p>Every <span class="pre">if</span> structure follows these rules:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>It begins with <span class="pre">if</span> followed by a
	<a href="#condexp">conditional expression</a> and then a block of statements.
	In this example, <span class="pre">roll == 7</span> is the conditional expression.
	A block may hold one or more multiple statements.</li>
	<li>Any number of <span class="pre">elif</span> structures may follow (including none).
	Each specifies its own conditional expression and a block of statements.</li>
	<li>If specified, a single <span class="pre">else</span> structure comes last.
	It has no conditional expression; only a block of statements.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Since <span class="pre">if</span> may be used as an expression, the above code can be simplified to:</p>
<pre>
result = if roll == 7
  "Perfect"
elif roll &lt; 7
  "Too low!"
else
  "Too high!"
</pre>
	<p>If a block has multiple statements, the expression in the last statement of the block
	is used as the value of that block.</p>
	<p>The above example can also be written on a single line:</p>
<pre>
result = if roll == 7 {"Perfect"} elif roll&lt;7 {"Too low!"} else {"Too high!"}
</pre>

	<h4>if clause</h4>
	<p>When an <span class="pre">if</span> structure has only a single block containing only a single statement,
	this can be written on a single line by appending an <span class="pre">if</span> clause to the statement:</p>
<pre>
bignumber = true if nbr &gt; 100
</pre>
	<p>That line is exactly equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
if nbr &gt; 100
  bignumber = true
</pre>

	<h2 id="condexp">Conditional Expressions</h2>
	<p>A wide variety of conditional expressions can be formulated, from simple equivalence or comparisons
	to complex algorithms that use logical operators, pattern matching, functions or methods.</p>

	<h3>True vs. False</h3>
	<p>A conditional expression evaluates to <span class="pre">true</span> or <span class="pre">false</span>.
	The integer number <span class="pre">0</span>, the <span class="pre">null</span> pointer,
	and <span class="pre">false</span> all evaluate to <span class="pre">false</span>.
	All other values evaluate to <span class="pre">true</span>.
	Thus:</p>
<pre>
// This statement will never execute
a += 1 if 0   // since 0 is equivalent to false

// This statement will always execute
a += 1 if "hello"
</pre>
	<p>These rules make it possible to use function or method calls as part of a conditional expression:</p>
<pre>
a += 1 if a.isOdd
</pre>
	<p>Conditional expressions are not just for <span class="pre">if</span> and <span class="pre">while</span>.
	A conditional expression may be used within any expression:</p>
<pre>
imm isOne Bool = (a == 1)    // isOne will be either true or false
</pre>
	
	<h3>Equivalence Operators</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">==</span> operator returns true if two values have the same content and type.
	<span class="pre">!=</span> (not equal) is true if they do not. For example:</p>
<pre>
x == 3.0        // Returns true if the local variable x's value is 3.0
x+1 != y        // Returns true if x is not exactly 1 greater than y
true != false   // Returns true
</pre>
	<p>As with the arithmetic operators, the <span class="pre">==</span> and <span class="pre">!=</span>
	operators are implemented as type-specific methods. 
	Thus, each type can establish its own rules for equivalence.
	For example, two floating point numbers could be evaluated as equal
	if they are within some margin of error (resulting from floating point calculation rounding errors).
	Similarly, two lists might be equal if they have the exact same contents.
	Some types may not implement the <span class="pre">==</span> method.</p>

	<h3>Comparison Operators</h3>
	<p>Comparison operators determine whether one value is greater or less than some other value. 
	They work only on types that are comparable, such as numbers.</p>
<pre>
x &gt;= 2          // Returns true if x is greater than or equal to 2 (&gt;, &lt;, &lt;= are variants)
2 &lt;= 2.0        // Returns false any time the types do not agree
</pre>
	<p>Float values are compared using the same closeness criteria described above.
	For one Float value to be less than another, it must be less by at least the comparable closeness.</p>
	<p>In some cases, a type can make its values comparable by implementing just the
	<span class="pre">&lt;=&gt;</span> (rocket-ship) operator/method.
	This returns an integer (rather than true or false): -1 if less, 0 if equal, and 1 if greater.</p>
<pre>
-2 <=> 4      // Returns -1
</pre>
	<p>Use of the <span class="pre">Comparable</span> trait would then implement the other
	comparison operators using the rocket-ship operator.</p>

	<h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
	<p>Acorn has three boolean operators:  
	'and', 'or' and 'not' ('!').
	For example:</p>
<pre>
0==3 or not 2&lt;3 and 3==3   // Returns true ('and' is evaluated before 'or')
</pre>
	<p>The logical operators work mostly how you would expect:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>As mentioned earlier, they treat 0, null and false as false. All other values are considered true.</li>
	<li>The boolean operators 'and' and 'or' will stop evaluating any time the answer is known for sure.
	Thus, the .isEmpty method will never be performed in this expression (making it similar to a simple 'if' statement):
<pre>
false and list.isEmpty
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>The logical operators have a lower precedence than evaluation operators, but higher than assignment.
	! has the highest precedence, then 'and', then 'or'.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Note:</b> 
	In case it is not obvious by now, these boolean operators are not the same
	as the boolean bit-wise logical operators described earlier.</p>

	<p><b>Note 2:</b>
	If a comparison operator or boolean operator is used outside the context of a control structure
	that wants a conditional expression (e.g., if), in most cases it will evaluate to a value of 'true' or 'false'.
	If the conditional expression just uses 'and' or 'or' operators, its value will be the
	last value evaluated in that expression.</p>
