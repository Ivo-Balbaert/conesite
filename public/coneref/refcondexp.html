    <div class="text">

	<p><span class="pre">if</span> decides which code block
	to perform based on the truth of one or more conditional expressions.
	Consider:</p>

<pre>
fn abs(x i32) i32
  imm result i32;
  if x &lt; 0
    result = -x
  else
    result = x
  result
</pre>
	<p><span class="pre">if</span> is used by this function to correctly
	return the positive, absolute value of x.
	<span class="pre">x &lt; 0</span> is a conditional expression that evaluates
	to true whenever x is a negative number. When the conditional evaluates as true,
	the subsequent block is performed, which converts x to its positive equivalent.
	When the conditional is not true, the block after the
	<span class="pre">else</span> is performed instead, which captures the value of x.</p>
	
	<h2 id="if">if variations</h2>
	<p>Before covering the logic of conditional expressions,
	let's summarize various ways to use
	<span class="pre">if</span>.</p>
	
	<h3>if as statement suffix</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">else</span> clause is optional; it need not be specified if there
	is no alternative action to perform when the condition is false.
	Furthermore, if the block consists of just one statement,
	then the <span class="pre">if</span> and condition can be written <b>after</b> the statement.
	Using this capability, we can re-implement the above function more concisely:
<pre>
fn abs(x i32) i32
  return -x if x &lt; 0
  x
</pre>
	
	<h3>if as expression</h3>
	<p>As with blocks, <span class="pre">if</span> can be used as an expression.
	This (along with implicit return) provides us with another way to write this function:</p>
<pre>
fn abs(x i32) i32
  if x &lt; 0
    -x
  else
    x
</pre>

	<h3>Multiple conditions</h3>
	<p>If we have more than one condition to test, each corresponding to
	a different block to perform, every condition after the first
	is preceded with <span class="pre">elif</span> (short for "else if").
	For example:</p>
<pre>
fn abs(x i32) i32
  if x &lt; 0
    -x
  elif x == 0
    0
  else
    x
</pre>

	<h2 id="condexp">Conditional Expressions</h2>
	<p>Conditional expressions are often just simple comparisons, as shown above.
	However, complex conditional expressions can be formulated that use
	logical operators, pattern matching, functions or methods.
	Let's walk through the possibilities, beginning with the basics.</p>

	<h3>True vs. False</h3>
	<p>A conditional expression evaluates to <span class="pre">true</span> or <span class="pre">false</span>.
	The integer number <span class="pre">0</span>, the <span class="pre">null</span> pointer,
	and <span class="pre">false</span> all evaluate to <span class="pre">false</span>.
	All other values evaluate to <span class="pre">true</span>.
	Thus:</p>
<pre>
// This statement will never execute
a += 1 if 0   // since 0 evaluates to false

// This statement will always execute
a += 1 if "hello"
</pre>
	<p>This applies to the (first) value returned by a function or method call:</p>
<pre>
a += 1 if a.isOdd
</pre>
	
	<h3>Equivalence</h3>
	<p>With most values, we can compare whether they are the same by using an equivalence operator.
	The <span class="pre">==</span> operator returns true if two values have the same content and type.
	<span class="pre">!=</span> (not equal) is true if they do not. For example:</p>
<pre>
x == 3.0        // Returns true if the local variable x's value is 3.0
x+1 != y        // Returns true if x is not exactly 1 greater than y
true != false   // Returns true
</pre>
	<p>As with the arithmetic operators, the <span class="pre">==</span> and <span class="pre">!=</span>
	operators are implemented as type-specific methods. 
	Thus, each type can establish its own rules for equivalence.
	For example, two floating point numbers could be evaluated as equal
	if they are within some margin of error (resulting from floating point calculation rounding errors).
	Similarly, two lists might be equal if they have the exact same contents.
	A type must implement the <span class="pre">==</span> method to ensure its values can be compared.</p>

	<h3 id="compop">Ordered Comparison</h3>
	<p>Comparison operators determine whether one value is greater or less than some other value. 
	They work only on types that are comparable, such as numbers.</p>
<pre>
x &gt;= 2          // Returns true if x is greater than or equal to 2 (&gt;, &lt;, &lt;= are variants)
2 &lt;= 2.0        // Returns false any time the types do not agree
</pre>

	<h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
	<p>Sometimes a conditional expression requires checking multiple conditions
	and then combining those results together into a single true/false determination.
	The boolean operators
	'and', 'or' and 'not' ('!') are used to accomplish this.
	These operators are distinctly different than the bitwise logic operators
	('&', '|', and '~') introduced in an earlier section.</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
0==3 or not 2&lt;3 and 3==3   // Returns true ('and' is evaluated before 'or')
</pre>
	<p>The logical operators work mostly how you would expect:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>As mentioned earlier, they treat 0, null and false as false. All other values are considered true.</li>
	<li>The boolean operators 'and' and 'or' will stop evaluating any time the answer is known for sure.
	Thus, the .isEmpty method will never be performed in this expression:
<pre>
false and list.isEmpty
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>The logical operators have a lower precedence than evaluation operators, but higher than assignment.
	'not' has the highest precedence, then 'and', then 'or'.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Expression usage</h3>
	<p>Conditional expressions need not only be found on control flow statements
	like <span class="pre">if</span>. They may also be incorporated as part of any
	arbitrary expression. For example:</p>
<pre>
imm isOne = (a == 1)    // isOne will be either true or false
</pre>
