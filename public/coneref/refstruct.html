	<h2>structs</h2>
	<p>A struct is a type used to package together several values of specific types.
	A struct may optionally also establish the methods used to handle its values.</p>
	
	<h3>struct Declaration</h3>
	<p>The declaration of a struct type names it and lists the named fields (values) in the structure and their types.
	By convention, type names begin with a capital letter:</p>
<pre>
struct Point
    x f32
    y f32
</pre>
	<p>Each field may specify a permission. If unspecified, <span class="pre">mut</span> is assumed.</p>
	<p>Field names that begin with an underscore are considered private.
	They cannot be accessed outside of the struct's methods.</p>

	<h3>struct Variables and Literals</h3>
	<p>Variable declarations may specify a declared struct type:</p>
<pre>
// two new points
imm pt1 Point;
imm pt2 Point;
</pre>
	<p>So long as the struct has no private fields, a new variable declaration 
	may be typed and initialized with a struct literal.
	The struct literal uses the struct's name and then the initial values for all fields in curly braces:</p>
<pre>
imm pt = Point {x: 3., y: 4.}
imm pt2 = Point {3., 4.} // Field names are optional
</pre>

	<h3>Copy vs. Move</h3>
	<p>As long as a struct has no fields that are references, assignment and function calls are
	handled by making a full copy of the struct, just like with integers and floats:
<pre>
imm pt = Point {x: 3f, y:4f}
imm pt2 = pt     // pt2 is a full copy
func(pt2)        // this function call creates a third copy
</pre>
	<p>Since they are independent copies, changing one will not change the other.</p>
	<p>Should the struct contain any references (and not implement .clone()),
	an assignment or function call actually moves the value:</p>
<pre>
struct Node
    nbr: &amp;mut i32
imm life = 42
imm node1 = Node {nbr: &amp;life}
imm node2 = node1
imm node3 = node1   // ERROR! node1 is no longer usable
</pre>
	
	<h3>struct References</h3>
	<p>struct copying has two potential limitations: a) the larger the struct, the slower the copy,
	b) changing a copy does not change the original. It is possible to address these limitations
	by borrowing a reference to a struct and then passing around and using the reference
	in place of the struct.
<pre>
fn main()
  imm pt = Point {x: 3f, y: 4f}
  imm dist = dist(&amp;mut pt)  // dist may modify the contents of pt
</pre>
	<p>Similarly, an allocator may be used to allocate a new struct.
	The allocator returns a reference to the struct:</p>
<pre>
imm pt = &amp;gc mut Point{x: 3f, y: 4f}
</pre>

	<h3>Field access</h3>
	<p>Any field within a struct may be accessed using the <span class="pre">.</span> operator,
	specifying the structure on the left and the field name on the right:</p>
<pre>
fn dist(pt Point)
    (pt.x*pt.x + pt.y*pt.y).sqrt()
</pre>
	<p>The same technique may be used to change a structure's field:</p>
<pre>
fn init(pt &amp;mut Point)
    pt.x = pt.y = 0f
</pre>
	<p>Mutation of s field is allowed only if the permissions on 
	both the variable <i>and</i> the field permit it.</p>
	<p>It is possible to use the <span class="pre">&amp;</span> operator to 
	obtain a borrowed reference to a specific field within a structure:</p>
<pre>
imm pt = Point{x: 3f, y: 4f}
imm refx = &amp;pt.x
*refx                     // 3f
</pre>

	<h3>Methods</h3>
	<p>Although a struct type need not declare any methods, it may.
	This includes one or more constructors (at least one is needed if the struct has any private fields).
	A drop method should also be defined if clean-up logic must be run before an instance is destroyed.</p>
	<p>These methods may be invoked on any instance of the struct.</p>
	
	<h2>tuples</h2>
	<p>A tuple is simply an ad hoc (undeclared) struct.
	When you return multiple values from a function, that is a tuple.
	When you use parallel assignment, that too is a tuple.</p>
