		</p>

		<p>A block is the basic unit for structured control flow.
			It holds a ordered collection of statements that are executed in order, starting with the first statement.
			It may also accumulate its own temporary, local state.
			Blocks that evaluate to some value may also be used in expressions.</p>
		<p>Before describing blocks, let's first cover statements.</p>
			
		<h2>Statements</h2>
		<p>A statement is typically some expression to be performed. If the expression evaluates to
			some value, it is then usually discarded by the statement.
			In addition to expression statements, there are other kinds of statements,
			such as <a href="refterm.html#vardcl">variable declarations</a>, 
			a block treated as a statement,
			or various statements used to control <a href="refflow.html">execution flow</a>.</p>
		<p>Most statements may be explicitly terminated with a semi-colon.
			However, specifying the semi-colon is not needed when the statement
			finishes at the end of a line, as is typically the case.
			This example show two expression statements:</p>
<pre>
mut a i32
imm b i32
a = 12   // Equivalent to: a = 12;
b = 5    // Equivalent to: b = 5;
</pre>
		<p>A single line may hold more than one statement. When this is done,
			use semi-colons to separate the statements:</p>
<pre>
a = 12; b = 5    // Equivalent to:  a = 12; b = 5;
</pre>
		<p>A statement may span multiple lines.
			When this is required, continuation lines should be indented to visually signal that all the lines
			constitute a single statement.</p>
<pre>
a = b + c + d
    - e + f     // Equivalent to a = b + c + d - e + f;
</pre>
		<p>A failure to indent continuation lines may sometimes lead the compiler
			to incorrectly believe the continuation line begins a new statement, rather than
			continuing one already in progress:</p>
<pre>
a = b + c + d    // Equivalent to: a = b + c + d;
- e + f          // Equivalent to: - e + f;
</pre>

		<h2>Blocks</h2>
		<p>Blocks offer a versatile, easy-to-apprehend way to structure logic.
	  A block's well-defined single point of entry and exit establishes clear
	  boundaries around control flow as well as the local context it manages.</p>
	  <p>Versatility comes from being able to nest different kinds of block easily within each other.
	  This inherent modularity is useful when used in conjunction
	  with control flow statements or to establish a context for compiler operations
		(e.g., safety constraints).</p>
	<p>Blocks support these roles:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Holding an ordered collection of statements</li>
		<li>Establishing a lexical scope for a local context</li>
		<li>Building and/or returning a value</li>
	  </ul>

	<h3>Ordered Collection of Statements</h3>
	<p>At its simplest, a block is merely a ordered set of statements which are
		executed one after another, in order.
		There are two ways to mark that several statements belong to the same block:
	<ul>
		<li>Wrap the block's statements inside curly braces:
<pre>
{
	a = 12
	b = 5
}
</pre>
		</li>
	<li>When a statement ends with a block, signal the start of the block
		with a colon, and then indent all of the block's statements which follow on separate lines.
<pre>
if a == 0:
	a = 12
b = 5        // Not part of if's inner block, since it is not indented.
</pre>
	<p>This convention makes more efficient use of vertical space,
		particularly for small blocks.</p>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Blocks may be specified within blocks:</p>
<pre>
{
  ++a;
  {
    ++b;
    --a;
  }
  a + b;
}
</pre>
	<p>The statements incrementing <span class="pre">b</span>
	and decrementing <span class="pre">a</span> comprise an interior block within
	an outer block. This particular example is a bit contrived,
	as there is no good reason for us to use an interior block here,
	since the logic would work the same if all statements belong to a single block.
  However, later we will see useful examples of blocks embedded within other blocks.</p>
		
	<h3 id="blockscope">Lexical Context</h3>
	<p>Execution of a block's statements always begins with the first statement,
	as one cannot jump into the middle of a block. 
	Likewise, execution of the block always finishes at the end of the block.
	This single-entrance and single-exit nature makes it possible for a block
	to create a temporary execution context that persists for the lifetime of the block
	and then is automatically cleaned up at the end of the block.</p>
	
	<h4>Local Variables</h4>
	<p>Any variable <a href="refterm.html#vardcl">declared</a> wihin a block
		provides a temporary working state for that block.
		Such variables are <i><a href="refterm.html#scope">local</a></i> to their block.
		They cannot be referenced or used outside of that scope.
		This silly example illustrates the block scope of declared variables:</p>
<pre>
{
	mut result = 0
	{
		mut sum = a + b
		result = sum
	}
	++result    // sum cannot be referenced in outer block
}
</pre>
	<p>The block where a variable is defined is considered to be its lexical scope.
	Scopes are nested from outer to inner, with global variables having the outer-most scope.
	Variables declared in outer scopes are accessible in any inner scope.
	However, the reverse is not true.
	Thus, the outer block may not refer to <span class="pre">sum</span>.</p>
	<p>If an inner block declares a local variable of the same name
	as an outer scope (including global variables), 
		the outer-scoped variable is effectively inaccessible
		throughout the lexical scope of that inner block.
		To avoid potential confusion, this should be avoided.</p>

	<h4>Resource Disposal</h4>
	<p>The execution lifetime of a local variable does not last beyond its lexical scope.
	At the end of the block, any resources acquired by local variables
	are automatically reclaimed. 
	Reclamation might encompass a wide variety of possible activities,
	including: freeing heap-allocated memory, decrementing counters,
	releasing locks, joining threads,
	or other type-based <a href="refinitdrop.html">finalization</a> activity
	that closes acquired resources or removes dependencies to other objects.</p>
		
	<h3>Blocks as expressions</h3>
	<p>Blocks that evaluate to a value may be used as an expression, embedded within a larger expression.
	When a block is used as an expression,
	its value is that of the last statement in the block.</p>
<pre>
// Using a block as an expression
a = {
	3.14
	6      // a's value will become 6
}
</pre>

	<h2 id="with">with blocks and this</h2>

	<p>A <span class="pre">with</span> block is a special kind of block able
		to focus its logic around a single value.
		Its sugar offers a concise way to invoke many methods on, or access fields belonging to, some value.
		Although it may resemble method chaining or cascades in other languages, 
		it is more versatile.</p>
	<p>A <span class="pre">this</span> block's simple mechanism consists of two aspects:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>implicit definition of a <span class="pre">this</span> variable within a block
			(not to be confused with 
			<a href="refmethod.html#self"><span class="pre">self</span></a>.)
		</li>
		<li>using operators that implicitly rely on the <span class="pre">this</span> variable</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Implicit <span class="pre">this</span> Variable</h2>
	<p>A <span class="pre">with</span> block is simply an expression followed by a code block.
		Throughout the block, the variable <span class="pre">this</span> is understood to hold
		the evaluated value of that expression.</p>
<pre>
// Calculate the value of 'this' (0.174533)
with Float.Pi/180:
	quarter = 90f * this // Use 'this' to convert to radians
	acute = 10f * this
</pre>
	<p>The above example is short-hand for:</p>
<pre>
{
	imm this = Float.Pi/180
	quarter = 90f * this // Use 'this' to convert to radians
	acute = 10f * this
}
</pre>
	<p>Since <span class="pre">with</span> blocks can be nested within each other,
		the value of <span class="pre">this</span> for any statement refers
		to the inner-most <span class="pre">with</span> block's expression's value.</p>

	<h2>'.' Prefix Operator</h2>
	<p>The convenience of a <span class="pre">with</span> block comes from using
	operators which implicitly work with the value of <span class="pre">this</span>.
	The most common of these is the dot ('.') operator, used to call methods or access fields.</p>
	<p>Normally, the '.' operator specifies some data object to the left,
		on which a method might be invoked or whose field is accessed.
		However, if no object is specified to the left of '.',
		<span class="pre">this</span> is assumed.
		It is common to find <span class="pre">with</span> block logic
		taking advantage of this shortcut:</p>
<pre>
// Normalize point to unit length
with &mut point:
	imm len = (.x * .x + .y * .y).sqrt
	if len > 0:
		.x /= len
		.y /= len
</pre>
	<p>This example uses <span class="pre">.x</span> and <span class="pre">.y</span> to access
		fields in <span class="pre">point</span>. This works because this block assigns
		<span class="pre">this</span> to the value of <span class="pre">point</span>,
		and <span class="pre">.x</span> is equivalent to <span class="pre">this.x</span>.
		The block's logic is cleaner and easier to read without having to place
		<span class="pre">point</span> ahead of every dot operator.</p>
	<p>Why is this approach is more versatile than method chaining or cascades?</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Called methods need not return <span class="pre">self</span>, as method chaining requires.</li>
	<li>Method calls may appear at any point in the block logic, instead of having to be sequenced together.</li>
	<li>It supports field access as well as method calls.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h2>'.[]' indexing</h2>
	<p>'.[]' may be used to access or modify some element of a collection:</p>
<pre>
with myScene.numbers:
	.[4] = 1.6      // Equivalent to: myScene.numbers[4] = 1.6
	.[6] = 1.9
	.sort       // Sort the list of numbers
</pre>

	<h2>'&lt;-' Prefix Operator</h2>
	<p>The &lt;- operator adds the element on the right to the collection on the left.
		If no collection is specified on the left, <span class="pre">this</span> is assumed.</p>
<pre>
// numbers is a vector of floating-point numbers
with myScene.numbers:
	&lt;- 3.4
	&lt;- 2.6
	&lt;- 1.4
	.sort
</pre>
	<p>This appends three floating point numbers to the list of numbers held in
		<span class="pre">myscene.numbers</span> and then re-sorts the numbers list 
		by calling the <span class="pre">sort</span> method.
	</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> If we just want to append three numbers without sorting:</p>
<pre>
myScene.numbers &lt;- [
	3.4
	2.6
	1.4
]
</pre>
